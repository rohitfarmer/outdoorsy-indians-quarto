    "section": "Where to begin and how to gain access to a SUP?",
    "text": "Where to begin and how to gain access to a SUP?\nWhen you start, you may not want to buy a SUP. SUPs, even though they have a smaller footprint than kayaks, are also of multiple types, can be expensive, need storage space, and make arrangements to transport them to water. All these take some planning and investment. You also do not know if you would like it or want to continue it as a long-term hobby. If you are in Maryland or most states in the USA, you can rent SUPs during the boating season, usually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. However, before heading out on your own on a rented SUP, I recommend first taking lessons in a group setting. It’s safer and will set you on the right path to explore further. Group classes are fun and have a low entry bar. Everyone is in the same boat (data joke) and motivates each other. Various outdoorsy organizations, such as REI, conduct classes frequently throughout the year or as weather permits.\nI started standup paddleboarding and kayaking by participating in classes organized by REI. The classes were conveniently located near my home, the instructors were terrific, and the REI provided all the necessary equipment, including a SUP, personal floatation device (PFD; life jacket), and accessories like dry bags for phones, car keys, etc. Lessons were long enough to get some practice time on the water but not overwhelming or physically straining. I did two classes, one for SUP and the second for kayaking, and my group comprised people from a wide age and fitness range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese courses and tours will cost you some money, and I know for us Indians, especially those living in a foreign country, one of our primary goals is to save money. However, I encourage you to fork out a little money and gain these experiences while you still can, and trust me, it will be worth it. Do not wait for a friend who might give you a free lesson on a rental one day; those opportunities are hard to come by and are nothing compared to REI or similar classes.\n\n\n\nEssentials\n\nBefore hitting the water, you’ll need to gather the essential equipment:\n\nPaddleboard: Choose a stable and beginner-friendly board. Wider and longer boards are generally more stable, making them ideal for beginners.\nPaddle: Ensure you have a correctly sized paddle that suits your height.\nPersonal Flotation Device (PFD): Safety first! Always wear a PFD when paddleboarding, especially if you’re not a confident swimmer.\nLeash: A leash connects you to your board, preventing it from drifting away if you fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nREI provides all the essential equipment if you join one of their classes. Most rental facilities also provide at least the PFD with the paddleboard. I have had experience of not getting a leash with a few rentals. If you are a beginner, it’s crucial to have a leash.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the Right Location\nSelecting the right location is crucial for a positive SUP experience. As a beginner, opt for calm, flatwater areas like:\n\nLakes\nSlow-moving rivers\nPonds\nSheltered bays\n\nAvoid strong currents, heavy boat traffic, and rough waves until you’ve gained more experience.\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nSafety should be your top priority. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind:\n\nCheck the weather forecast and wind conditions before heading out.\nWear sunscreen and appropriate clothing, considering weather and water temperature.\nFamiliarize yourself with local regulations and waterway rules.\nLet someone know your paddleboarding plans and estimated return time.\nPractice falling and remounting your board in a controlled environment."

Invest in water shoes, a life jacket, and clothing for water activities. In 2023, I was planning to buy an inflatable standup paddle board and kayak hybrid that I could easily store and transport in my Honda Civic, but for several reasons, I could not. So I decided to buy a life jacket that fit me well and had more features than the ones you get when you rent a boat. Those rental ones are basic and soaked in other people’s sweat, which I find gross, even for a few hours. In addition to my life jacket, I also own a pair of water shoes, boater’s gloves, a long-sleeved hooded shirt, a bucket hat, and a pair of convertible pants for my water activities.\nClean gear that fits you well makes the activity more efficient and comfortable. You could spend more time thinking about and practicing your paddling skills than the gross rental life jacket, etc. It also makes you feel more invested in your hobby and will help you to sustain it longer.\nSome other accessories that I find helpful are a dry bag to keep my car keys, wallet, snack, bandana, and a phone cover with floatation to carry my phone around my neck to take photos. I like the flotation feature because a typical waterproof case can protect your phone from water, but it will sink if you drop it in the lake."

    "text": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a SUP\nStandup paddleboarding (SUP) has gained popularity over the years, leading to various paddle boards designed to suit different activities and conditions. Here are some of the main types of standup paddle boards:\n\nAll-Around/Touring Boards: These are versatile boards suitable for various conditions, making them great for beginners. They’re stable, maneuverable, and can be used on calm water, small waves, and light touring.\nSurf SUPs: Explicitly designed for surfing, these boards are shorter and more maneuverable. They are often narrower and have a rocker (upward curve) in the nose and tail, allowing them to handle waves effectively.\nFlatwater/Race Boards: These boards are long and narrow, built for speed and efficiency on flat water. They have a pointed nose and a displacement hull design that helps them slice through the water more smoothly.\nInflatable SUPs (iSUPs): These boards are made from durable, lightweight materials that can be inflated and deflated. They are great for portability and storage. Inflatable SUPs come in various styles, including all-around, touring, and racing.\nYoga/Fitness SUPs: These boards are wide, stable, and designed with a soft top for comfort. They provide a stable platform for practicing yoga, fitness routines, and other on-water exercises.\nFishing SUPs: These boards have features like extra stability, attachment points for fishing gear, and storage compartments. They’re designed for anglers who want to combine SUP with fishing.\nWhitewater SUPs: Built to handle river currents and rapids, whitewater SUPs are typically shorter, wider, and more robust to withstand the challenges of fast-moving water.\nWind SUPs: These boards can attach a sail, allowing you to use wind power for propulsion. They’re designed for those who want to combine paddleboarding with windsurfing.\nCruiser/Touring SUPs: Similar to touring boards, these SUPs are designed for longer-distance paddling and exploration. They often have additional attachment points for gear and are optimized for stability and tracking.\nKids’ SUPs: Smaller, lighter boards designed for children. They provide a safe and fun introduction to paddleboarding for younger enthusiasts.\nMulti-Person SUPs: These oversized boards are designed to accommodate more than one paddler. They’re great for family outings or group activities.\n\nWhen choosing a standup paddleboard, consider your skill level, the type of water you’ll be using it on (calm lakes, rivers, ocean waves), and the activities you want to engage in (touring, surfing, fitness, etc.). Board size, shape, volume, and construction materials are important factors. Testing different types of SUPs or seeking advice from experienced paddleboarders before purchasing is a good idea.\n\nFeatures of a typical SUP\nA typical standup paddleboard (SUP) comprises various components and features contributing to its design, performance, and functionality. Here are the key features you’ll find on most SUPs:\n\nDeck Pad: The deck pad is the cushioned area where you stand at the top of the board. It provides traction, comfort, and grip, helping you maintain balance and control.\nCarry Handle: A sturdy handle located in the center of the board makes it easier to carry the SUP to and from the water. Some boards may have multiple handles for different carrying options.\nTie-Down Points: These are attachment points on the board’s surface where you can secure gear, such as a dry bag, cooler, or fishing equipment, using bungee cords or straps.\nLeash Attachment: A leash attachment point is typically located at the back of the board, allowing you to secure the leash to your ankle or calf. This prevents the board from drifting away if you fall off.\nFin System: SUPs have fins that help with stability, tracking (maintaining a straight line), and maneuverability. The number and configuration of fins vary; some boards have a single center fin, while others have multiple fins.\nNose and Tail: The board’s front (nose) and back (tail) have different shapes and designs depending on the board’s intended use. For example, surf SUPs have a more pointed nose for better wave performance, while touring boards have a rounder nose for better stability and tracking.\nRails: Rails are the edges of the board that come into contact with the water. They can be soft or hard, rounded or sharp, and affect the board’s stability and maneuverability in different conditions.\nVolume and Thickness: The volume and thickness of a board affect its buoyancy and stability. Boards with more volume are more stable but can be slower, while boards with less volume are more maneuverable.\nConstruction Material: SUPs can be made from various materials, including foam, fiberglass, epoxy, carbon fiber, and inflatable PVC. Each material has its weight, durability, performance, and cost characteristics.\nDeck Bungee System: Some boards, especially touring and all-around models, have a deck bungee system that provides additional storage space on the front of the board. This is useful for securing items like a life jacket or a dry bag.\nRocker: The rocker refers to the curvature of the board from nose to tail. More rocker makes the board more maneuverable, while less rocker enhances speed and tracking.\nTail Shape: Different tail shapes, such as square, pintail, or swallowtail, impact the board’s turning ability and stability.\nVent Plug: Inflatable SUPs and some hard boards have a vent plug that allows air to escape and prevent damage from temperature changes or pressure.\nGraphics and Design: SUPs come in various colors, patterns, and graphics. While this doesn’t affect performance, it can add personalization and style to your board.\n\nRemember that the specific features of an SUP can vary based on the type of board, manufacturer, and intended use. Choosing a board that suits your skill level, preferred activities, and the conditions you’ll be paddling in is essential."

    "text": "Photo by Tegan Mierle on Unsplash\n\n\nBy incorporating campfire games into your camping trip, you ensure entertainment and create opportunities for learning and a deeper connection with the natural environment. These activities encourage kids to engage their senses, think critically, and appreciate the beauty of the outdoors.\n\nI Spy:\n\nHow to Play: Choose one player to start. They say, “I spy with my little eye, something that is…” and give a clue about an object they see in their surroundings. For example, “I spy something green.” Other players take turns guessing the chosen object, asking questions like “Is it a tree?” or “Is it a leaf?”\nExpansion: To make it more nature-focused, encourage kids to spot objects in the natural environment around them. For instance, “I spy something with feathers,” or “I spy something that’s moving in the water.”\n\n20 Questions:\n\nHow to Play: One player thinks of an object, animal, or plant related to the camping environment. Other players take turns asking yes or no questions to guess what it is. They can ask questions like “Is it alive?” or “Is it larger than a breadbox?” Players have a limit of 20 questions to make their guesses.\nExpansion: Use this game as an opportunity to teach kids about the local wildlife and flora. For example, the chosen object could be a pine tree, and kids can ask questions to identify it correctly.\n\nWould You Rather:\n\nHow to Play: Take turns asking each other “Would you rather” questions, presenting two options. For instance, “Would you rather have the ability to fly or breathe underwater?” Each player chooses their preferred option and explains why.\nExpansion: Customize the questions to the camping experience. For example, “Would you rather sleep under the stars or inside a cozy cabin?” This sparks discussions about camping preferences and introduces kids to various aspects of outdoor life.\n\nStorytelling Circle:\n\nHow to Play: Sit in a circle, and one person begins a story with a sentence or two. They then pass the storytelling to the next person, who continues the narrative. Continue around the circle, each person adding a sentence or two to build the story.\nExpansion: To make the storytelling educational, set a theme related to the camping trip. Encourage kids to include details about the natural world, such as encounters with animals, interesting plants, or exciting adventures outdoors.\n\nCampfire Charades:\n\nHow to Play: Write down a list of words or phrases related to nature or camping on paper. Fold and place them in a container. One player selects a paper and acts out the word or phrase without speaking while the others guess.\nExpansion: Prepare a list of nature-themed words, animals, or camping activities for charades. This adds an educational aspect and promotes creativity and imagination as kids act out scenarios like “building a campfire” or “soaring like an eagle.”\n\nRiddle Time:\n\nHow to Play: Take turns presenting riddles related to the natural world. Provide clues, and let others guess the answer. For example, “I’m brown and furry, with a bushy tail. What am I?” (Answer: Squirrel)\nExpansion: Create riddles that challenge kids’ knowledge of local wildlife, plants, or geological features. Encourage them to think critically and apply what they’ve learned during the camping trip to solve the riddles.\n\nCampfire Sing-Along:\n\nHow to Play: Bring along musical instruments or sing acapella. Gather around the campfire and sing traditional campfire songs, such as “Kumbaya” or “This Land Is Your Land.” Encourage everyone to join in and share their favorite songs.\nExpansion: Include nature-themed songs in your repertoire. Songs about animals, forests, and outdoor adventures can enhance the camping experience. Provide background information about the songs, like the inspiration behind them or any connections to the environment.\n\nMystery Sound Game:\n\nHow to Play: Turn off all other sounds around the campfire, including flashlights, and have everyone close their eyes. One person (the “sound maker”) produces a sound from nature, like mimicking a bird call, rustling leaves, or the sound of a flowing stream. The other players listen carefully and try to guess what the sound represents.\nExpansion: After each sound is guessed, discuss the source of the sound and its role in the natural world. For instance, you can explain how birds use calls for communication or how the rustling of leaves can signal the presence of animals.\n\nNature Bingo:\n\nPreparation: Create bingo cards with pictures or descriptions of various natural elements commonly found in your camping area, such as pinecones, birds, mushrooms, or different types of leaves. You can also find printable nature bingo cards online.\nHow to Play: Hand out the bingo cards and markers to the participants. As you explore the campsite or go on a nature walk, encourage kids to mark off the items they spot on their bingo cards. The first one to complete a row, column, or diagonal shouts “Bingo!” and wins a small prize or gets to choose the next activity.\nEducational Value: Nature bingo promotes observation skills and familiarity with local flora and fauna. It encourages kids to pay attention to their surroundings and learn about different elements of nature.\n\nConstellation Spotting:\n\nPreparation: Before camping, research and print out a star chart or download a stargazing app suitable for your location and time of year.\nHow to Play: On a clear night, gather around the campfire or lie on blankets and gaze at the night sky. Using the star chart or app, identify and discuss constellations and planets visible that evening. Encourage kids to connect the dots and imagine the shapes represented by the stars.\nEducational Value: Constellation spotting introduces kids to astronomy and the wonders of the night sky. It teaches them about the movement of celestial objects and helps them appreciate the vastness of the universe.\n\n\nThese campfire games offer educational and entertaining activities to enhance your camping experience with kids.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The Melvin C. Hazen Trail\n\n\nThis year, I set my sights on exploring the trails nestled in the heart of the bustling cities within the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV area). A dear friend encouraged me to document these urban adventures through blogging, with the goal of offering fellow enthusiasts a glimpse into these distinctive hikes and trails.\nOn one wintry weekend, as part of my ongoing city exploration series, I embarked on the Melvin C. Hazen Trail. Nestled within the urban landscape, this trail offers a delightful slice of nature that has the uncanny ability to make you feel as though you’ve left the city far behind. The rustic trailhead can be found at Melvin C. Hazen Park, setting the stage for a captivating journey.\nTo make this experience even more immersive, we decided to rely on public transportation. Our starting point was the Cleveland Metro Station, conveniently located on the red line of the D.C. metro system. From there, we ventured northward to commence our adventure.\nThe Melvin C. Hazen Trail is a modest 1-mile out-and-back trail, adorned with several enchanting and easy stream crossings, facilitated by stepping stones and fallen trees. It’s worth noting that during periods of elevated water levels, the stream may overflow, necessitating waterproof hiking shoes. Fortunately for us, this particular outing took place during the winter, sparing us from such concerns.\n\nThe trail is well-marked and falls under the category of easy hikes. While I hesitate to classify it as a true hike due to its relatively short distance, it offers a picturesque walk that effortlessly transports you away from the city bustle. It’s an accessible escape into tranquility and nature.\nMelvin C. Hazen Trail also enjoys a reputation as a haven for bird nesting and birdwatching. Thus, a return visit during the spring or summer promises to be a birdwatcher’s paradise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of my ongoing city exploration project, I’m gearing up to elevate the challenge by extending the journey to Rock Creek Park. Fortunately, the Melvin C. Hazen Trail conveniently provides access to the Rock Creek Trail, opening up exciting possibilities for future adventures. I invite you to stay tuned for further updates as I continue to uncover the hidden gems within our urban landscapes.\nTrail Map link:\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/reservation-630.htm\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Photo by Caspian Dahlström on Unsplash\nSurvival should not be the first thing to come to mind while thinking about the great outdoors - it should be fun, adventure, mesmerizing views, a star-filled night, the sound of a waterfall, encountering wildlife, and making memories with your loved ones. However, as soon as you step outside the comforts and protection of your house, you are subjected to the elements and unforeseen difficult situations. Therefore, heading out with some basic preparedness is always helpful, especially with a family, including small children. This post is inspired by the famous 5Cs of survivability and the ten essentials by the National Park Services. And I hope these essential principles serve as your compass, guiding you through the rugged terrain and helping you emerge victorious in the face of nature’s trials."

I know it’s harder done than said, and freaking out in the face of a disaster is natural - especially when your kids are involved. However, maintaining a sense of calmness is your greatest asset. Panic clouds judgment and impedes decision-making. Instead, take a deep breath and embrace the stillness within. Calmness allows you to assess your situation, consider your options, and formulate a rational plan. A calm mind can save your life even in the face of danger."

Accidents and injuries can happen unexpectedly, and being prepared with a first aid kit can make a significant difference in managing medical situations effectively. What a first aid kit should include depends on the nature of the activity and the people involved. Carrying a well-stocked first aid kit is a proactive step towards ensuring safety during outdoor expeditions. However, at a minimum, a good kit should include essential items like adhesive bandages, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes/creams, pain relievers, and any personal medications. Additionally, items such as a CAT tourniquet, splint materials, blister treatment, and compact emergency blankets are invaluable for addressing a variety of potential injuries."

    "text": "Cutting: tools for crafting and survival\nA cutting tool, such as fixed blade knives, multitools, axes, and saws (all fall under this category), can make a significant difference in your attempt at survival. These tools can be used for opening a first aid kit, crafting shelter, procuring food, and processing wood for fire, amongst numerous other things. I always keep a small Swiss Army Knife in my car that goes to my day back or waist pack when I hit the trail or a park with kids. If needed, I also carry a bigger multitool with a plier and a small saw that adds more functionality without adding much weight to my pack. Besides multitools, a fixed blade full tang knife is essential while camping overnight. If you are car camping, you can carry all three. However, a fixed-blade knife would be more reliable while backpacking camping, especially for processing firewood.\nWhile car camping, I carry an 11-inch foldable saw, a multitool, and a fixed-blade knife. When writing this post, I have not gone backpacking camping, so I am still determining what I will take. But it most likely is my Morakniv full-tang fixed blade knife."

    "text": "Combustion and light: harnessing the power of fire\nFire is a primal force that has been humanity’s ally for millennia. It provides warmth, light, a means to cook food, and a psychological boost in challenging times. In your survival kit, carry fire-starting tools like a box of matches (waterproof if possible), lighter, ferro rod, etc. Setting things up on fire is relatively easy. However, building a good fire for keeping warm for an extended period or cooking food can take some skills. Therefore, learning and practicing the fire building - from gathering tinder to kindler to fule and creating a sustainable blaze is helpful and fun. In the wilderness, fire is more than survival; it symbolizes resilience and adaptability.\nOn day hikes, I usually carry a small Bic lighter; they hardly weigh and always work. I carry waterproof matches, Bic lighters (small and big), a Ferro rod, and some fire-starting cubes for car camping. Fire-starting cubes are excellent while camping. They are effortless and can reduce the burden of finding the right tinder and kindling material. I like to use them, especially on a cold morning when I want to get the fire going quickly, mostly on its own, while cooking my breakfast.\nA campfire can keep you warm and cook your food, but it’s not luminous or portable enough to let you navigate the campsite, set up a shelter, or go to the bathroom. Therefore, you need a dedicated battery-operated light source, which could be as simple as your phone’s camera flash or a cheap flashlight from the Dollar Store or Walmart. However, having a headlamp is most versatile in its utility."

    "text": "Cover: sheltering yourself from the elements\nProper clothing is your first line of defense against the harsh realities of the wilderness. Dressing appropriately for the environment is crucial to regulate body temperature and prevent hypothermia or heatstroke. Layering is critical, as it allows you to adjust to changing conditions. Sturdy, comfortable footwear is a must to navigate rugged terrain and prevent blisters. Remember, in the wild, your clothing is not just an outfit; it’s your shield against nature’s challenges.\nBesides clothing, tarps (rain fly), ponchos (rain gear), and tents form the second line of defense against the elements. These cover options shield you from rain, wind, and sun, providing a safe haven to rest and regroup. Whether you are setting up a makeshift shelter or using a compact tent, having the means to create a protective barrier against the wild is essential.\nDepending on the weather forecast, I carry a lightweight poncho on a day hike, which can also be spread on the ground to sit or lie down. If I am not carrying my multipurpose poncho, I carry a lightweight waterproof ground sheet/blanket for lying down. I do not carry tarps or tents on a day hike. However, while car camping with family, I carry several tarps for extra rain cover over our tent and cooking area and one emergency poncho for each family member."

Water is paramount to survival, and having the means to collect and store it is non-negotiable. Containers can also be used to store edible plants, insects, or small game you might come across. Choose containers that are durable, leak-proof, and lightweight for easy portability.\nFor a short day hike, I usually carry two Smart (plastic) water bottles as they are lightweight, and I am not in danger of getting stranded for an extended period where I have to source water from my surroundings and purify it by boiling. However, if I am camping, I keep plastic water bottles/jugs as primary storage and a metal container, be it a water bottle (single-walled) or a kettle to boil the water. Of course, if you are backpacking, you will carry a kettle to boil the water for your ready-to-eat meals and coffee.\nIf you go to the beach, carry a double-walled insulated water bottle. It will add to the overall weight but keep your water cool even if you put it on the warm sand."

From setting up shelter to crafting tools and traps, cordage is the lifeline that enables you to secure, tie, and create. Whether paracord, natural fibers, or improvised materials, having a good supply of cordage opens up a world of possibilities in the wild.\nI am a big fan of paracords from Dollar Tree (25 ft) and Temu.com (100 ft) for setting up tarps over my tent and cooking area. I use the 100 ft cord for the tarp’s ridgeline and 25 ft cords for the guylines, and so far, they have reached even the most distant spread of trees around my campsites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nParacords from Dollar Tree and Temu are cheap, but I would not trust them for critical load-bearing tasks. Even though they are sold as paracords, they do not have any load-bearing capacity rating. The rated 550 paracords should have a load-bearing capacity of 550 lbs.\n\n\nBesides paracords, I also use tarred nylon twine #18 from Walmart’s fishing equipment section. They are also called banklines, and the famous one is #36. Bank lines are much cheaper than paracords and useful for crafts where you want to cut the cord and probably leave it in the wild. I use bank lines to make prusik knots to tension my tarp on the ridgeline."

I also tend to download offline maps of the region I will be traveling to in case there is poor internet connectivity, which usually is many National Parks.\nBesides Google Maps, I also install alternative navigation software that does not depend on the internet, such as OsmAnd+ or Organic Maps. I also recommend paper maps and a compass. However, I realize that only a few people can navigate using a paper map and a compass. It’s a skill worth taking up, and several outdoorsy organizations teach it, including your local REI store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSince our mobile phones are such an integral part of our lives, in addition to keeping my phone in a sturdy phone case, I also carry a waterproof case with floatation that I can hang around my neck with lanyards while I am on the water either kayaking or stand up paddle boarding. Just keeping your phone in a waterproof casing is enough for the rain, but it will sink if it is dropped in the water. Therefore, a case with flotation capabilities is a must.\n\n\nWhile camping (with family), we also carry cheap walkie-talkie radios that kids can use while going to the bathroom or playing near the campsite. Unlike cell phones, radios within range do not need internet or communication towers to work."

You are invading their home, so they will not like it and might want to hurt you. So, insect repellents are a must. They protect you from the discomfort of insect bites and insect-borne diseases. Please check the recommended dosage and type of insect repellent for kids before heading out.\nFor bears, while camping or going on long hikes like in the Shenandoah National Parks, I always carry a bear spray can with me. However, before carrying a bear spray, check the park rules if they are allowed and learn how to use them before they are needed in action. Other nonchemical methods to deter a black bear, like a pressure horn or a jingle bell attached to your pack, let the bear know there are people around.\nBeaches are not the only place you might need a splash of sunscreen. Depending upon where you are hiking, you might encounter long stretches of unshaded regions where you may need sun protection. Therefore, keep a small tube of sunscreen."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Chair Compass Pose\n\n\nAs the cool breeze rustles the palm leaves and the golden sun begins its ascent over the horizon, there’s no better way to start your day than with a yoga session on the serene Palolem Beach in Goa. November in Goa marks the beginning of the peak tourist season, and what better way to find your inner peace amidst the vibrant energy of this coastal paradise? In this blog, we will guide you through the magic of doing yoga at Palolem Beach in the refreshing mornings of November.\nPalolem Beach, located towards far South of Goa, is renowned for its pristine beauty. The soft, powdery sands stretch for miles, fringed by swaying palm trees and the gentle lapping of the Arabian Sea. November brings pleasant weather to this tropical haven, making it an ideal time to visit as well as for the practice of Yoga.\nArriving early in the morning ensures you get your pick of the best spots on the beach. The soft sand near the shoreline or a quiet corner under the shade of a palm tree can be your perfect yoga mat. You may want to carry a thin yoga mat to ensure the surface under the feet is levelled.\n\n\n\nCrescent Moon Pose\n\n\nBegin your practice with Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) as the first rays of the sun touch the earth. This sequence not only warms up your body but also connects you with nature’s rhythm. I usually progress with a nice stretch of my hamstrings followed by backward bending and standing postures. Side bending and twists are my favourite towards the end while I cool off the asana practice.\nAlthough solo practice is serene, you can also join one of the many yoga classes offered by local instructors or resorts along the beach. They often provide mats and expert guidance, enhancing your experience.\n\n\n\nRevolved Head to Knee Pose\n\n\nThe rhythmic sound of waves crashing on the shore serves as a natural mantra. Let it guide your breath and movements, promoting mindfulness and tranquillity. After your asanas, find a comfortable seated position and indulge in meditation. The beach’s soothing ambiance makes it an excellent place to find inner peace.\nPracticing yoga on a beach offers numerous benefits, including improved flexibility, reduced stress, and a deep connection with nature. The cool November weather is conducive to outdoor activities, ensuring a comfortable yoga experience. The beach’s natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere enhance your practice’s effectiveness. Many shacks and cafes open early, allowing you to savor a healthy breakfast or freshly squeezed juice after your practice.\n\n\n\nBaby Grasshopper Pose\n\n\nBeach yoga, while incredibly rewarding, does come with its fair share of challenges. Here are some common struggles practitioners might encounter when practicing yoga on the beach.\n\nThe sandy and often uneven surface of the beach can make it challenging to maintain balance during yoga poses, especially standing poses like Tree Pose or Warrior III. So the best spot would be the partially dry sand strip which is levelled by the water.\nSand has a way of getting everywhere, including your yoga mat and clothing. It can be uncomfortable and may require extra cleaning after your practice. However, the sand would soon get dry and shed off easily after some time. It is better to accept and embrace the natural scrub.\nBeaches are often windy, and this can make it difficult to stay in certain poses or maintain focus during meditation. It’s a good idea to use heavier items to hold down your mat and belongings.\nWhile practicing yoga in the morning can be refreshing, the sun can quickly become intense, leading to overheating and discomfort. Sunscreen and proper hydration are essential. Anytime between 5:30 am to 6:00 am is a good time to start, under a clear sky.\nBeaches can be popular and noisy places, with people playing music, talking loudly, or children playing nearby. These distractions can make it hard to find inner peace, so starting early is the only solution.\nDepending on the location, you might encounter insects or wildlife during your practice. It’s important to be mindful of your surroundings. You may find a lot of crab colonies if you are close to the exposed wet sand as the water recedes in the morning.\nBeaches often lack the amenities found in traditional yoga studios like changing rooms so plan accordingly and bring what you need. In my case, the stay was bang on beach so it was hardly a struggle but I missed my water bottle, hand towel and the sun protection on the first day. I had walked more than 700 m towards north to find a good spot so going back to the room wasn’t an option and the shops were yet to open.\n\n\n\n\nFlying Lizard Pose\n\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe that the benefits of practicing yoga on the beach, including the sound of the waves and the connection to nature, far outweigh the struggles. It can be a transformative and unforgettable experience if you’re prepared for the unique conditions of beach yoga.\nYoga at Palolem Beach in the mornings of November is a soul-nourishing experience. It’s a blend of physical wellness, mental serenity, and a strong connection with the stunning natural surroundings. So, if you find yourself in Goa during this time, don’t miss the opportunity to greet the day with yoga on this paradise beach – it’s an experience you’ll cherish forever.\nNamaste!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This engaging pastime appeals to people of all ages who are looking for adventure, an opportunity to explore new places, or simply a fun activity to do with family and friends."

    "text": "History of Geocaching\nThe game of geocaching started shortly after the removal of selective availability from the Global Positioning System (GPS) in May 2000, which significantly increased the accuracy of civilian GPS. The first documented cache placement took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer, a computer consultant who wanted to test the accuracy by hiding a navigational target in the woods. He placed a container in Oregon filled with various items such as books, software, and a slingshot and then posted the coordinates online. This idea quickly caught on and has evolved into a global phenomenon with millions of geocaches hidden around the world."

These are typically waterproof containers containing a logbook where finders record their names and the date they found it. Larger containers may also contain items (informally called swags) for trading, such as toys, trinkets, or books. The basic rules for geocaching are simple: if you take something from the cache, you should leave something of equal or greater value; write about your find in the cache logbook; since you are mostly likely using a mobile app to locate the caches, make an entry in the online activity section, and most importantly leave a TFTC (Thank you For The Cache) message for the person who hid the cache."

    "text": "Getting Started with Geocaching\nTo start geocaching, one needs a GPS device or a smartphone with a geocaching app installed (Android, iOS). Participants can create a free account on websites like Geocaching.com, the largest and most popular geocaching platform, to access the coordinates of geocaches. They can then choose a cache to search for based on location, difficulty, terrain, and type and use their GPS device to help find it. I usually use my Android app to locate all the caches near my current location and since, at the time of writing this post, I only had a free license. I select the caches that are freely available and read their description to find out their difficulty level, size, and also things like if there is a parking nearby, or if it is in the woods, then how far I will have to walk from the parking, etc. This information is beneficial when you are heading out with kids. There is only so much I can walk with a toddler from the parking lot before they give in. I also look at the activity log to see the latest date on which a particular cache was found. To make sure that it’s not missing and what is the current condition. Usually, people do not reveal the exact spot, but they do give hints that may be helpful in locating it, especially in tricky areas.\n\nYou can also Hide your Cache\nWhile the majority of people participate in finding the caches, you can also hide and maintain your caches for others to find. After all, someone else volunteered to hide and maintain the cache that you have just found. I have not done that yet, but it’s on my radar, and I am scouting areas and collecting swag from my kid’s discarded toy stash. To hide a cache, you can again go to the same Geocaching.com and create a submission, which goes through an approval process before it appears online. Here is an excellent video that explains how to create a submission."

    "text": "Conclusion\nSo far, my experience with geocaching in Maryland, USA, has been fantastic. I have found two caches with my daughter, and it was fun for both of us. The first one was a small plastic bottle that was half buried in the ground in the woods of a local park (photo above). The second was a wooden box inserted in the stump of the LittleFreeLibrary post (my daughter’s YouTube video about it). I also tried another one with my family, but we had to hike a bit in the woods, and before we could reach it, our three-year-old got tired and compelled us to return halfway. For the same reason I have not tried more challenging ones yet since that may require me going by myself to either spend more time in locating the cache or hike a bit to a more tricky area. However, with my limited experience with geocaching, it’s a fun outdoor activity to do with kids and by yourself as well."

While camping with little children might seem daunting, with some preparation and the right mindset, it can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for parents and kids. When we moved from India to the USA, camping was one of the most desired things we wanted to do, and why not, afterall the USA is about the great outdoors! However, planning our first camping trip took some effort and help from an American friend who had experience. I have compiled this guide to walk you through the essential steps and tips for a successful tent camping trip with young children. By tent camping, I mean your drive to a managed campground and set up a tent to camp, also called car camping. Any gear recommendation in this post is for decent budget versions to help you get outdoors and not get discouraged by the prohibitive cost of premium gear. However, if you can afford it, then the sky is the limit, and I recommend reaching out to an outdoor fitter store like REI, DICKs’ etc.\nFor beginners, check out this article on Camping101."

    "section": "Plan Your Trip",
    "text": "Plan Your Trip\nPlanning is crucial to ensure a smooth camping experience with little ones. Here’s how to approach it:\n\nTrip Duration and Booking: Consider the length of your camping trip. For beginners with young children, it’s often best to start with a shorter trip, perhaps a one-night getaway over the weekend, to gauge your family’s comfort level and address potential challenges - that’s how we started. Start looking for campgrounds well in advance to verify they fulfill all your family’s requirements. Most managed campgrounds require an advanced booking, and popular destinations quickly fill up.\nWeather Considerations: Check the weather forecast for the duration of your trip. It will help you pack appropriate clothing and gear to keep everyone comfortable and safe, especially for sudden weather changes in mountainous or coastal areas.\nChoose the Right Campground:\nSelecting the appropriate campground sets the foundation for a positive camping experience with young children. Here are some aspects to consider:\n\nFamily-Friendly Amenities: Look for campgrounds that offer family-friendly amenities such as clean and well-maintained restrooms, access to potable water, and designated family camping areas. These facilities can significantly simplify your camping experience and ensure your children’s comfort. I have little kids; therefore, I always book a campsite closer to the bathroom complex.\nActivities for Kids: Check if the campground offers activities suitable for children, such as nature trails/centers, playgrounds, or swimming areas. These activities will keep your little ones entertained and excited about the camping trip.\nProximity to Home: For your first camping trip with young children, consider choosing a campground near home. This proximity can provide reassurance, making it easier to address any unexpected situations or needs that may arise."

    "section": "Pack Thoughtfully",
    "text": "Pack Thoughtfully\nPacking efficiently and thoughtfully is critical to ensuring your family’s comfort during the camping trip. Here’s what to include:\n\nTent: Opt for a spacious tent that accommodates your family comfortably. It’s tempting to buy a large tent with multiple rooms or dividers to create separate sleeping spaces for children and adults. However, though excellent, they are expensive and not always necessary. A budget tent, for example, Coleman Sundome, could be sufficient while starting. Practice setting it up at home to become familiar with the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBudget tents do not hold well in heavy rain. So consider camping on dry days or buy a tarp for an extra layer over your tent if needed.\n\n\n\nSleeping Gear: Each family member should have either a sleeping bag or a blanket, a sleeping pad, and a pillow. For our little ones, we opt for blankets over sleeping bags. Familiar bedding, like their favorite stuffed animals or blanky, can help children feel secure and at ease.\nClothing: Pack clothing suitable for the expected weather conditions, including layers for cooler evenings. Bring extra clothes for children, as they can get messy while exploring. Waterproof and breathable clothing is beneficial in wet or rainy weather.\nFood and Cooking Supplies: Plan simple, kid-friendly meals that are easy to prepare at the campsite. Pack a portable camp stove, cookware, utensils, disposable plates, and cutlery for convenience. Always bring enough water for everyone, even if the campground has potable water outlets. And don’t forget to bring a cooler with ice packs to store perishable food items.\nFirst Aid Kit and Prescription Medication: Assemble a kit that may include essential items like adhesive bandages, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes/creams, pain relievers, and personal prescription medications. Additionally, items such as a CAT tourniquet, splint materials, blister treatment, and compact emergency blankets are invaluable for addressing a variety of potential injuries. However, don’t overwhelm yourself by thinking about all the possible scenarios where things can go wrong. If you are camping in a managed campground, you will be just a phone call away from help.\nEntertainment: Bring games, books, and activities to keep children engaged during downtime (rain). Consider nature guides, binoculars/bugnoculars, or a magnifying glass for educational exploration."

    "section": "Practice Camping Skills",
    "text": "Practice Camping Skills\nBefore embarking on your camping trip, familiarize your children with essential camping skills:\n\nSetting Up the Tent: Pitch the tent in your backyard or a nearby park before the trip. Involve your children to teach them how to assemble and disassemble the tent. This hands-on experience will boost their confidence and help them feel more at home at the campsite. My kids love hammering the tent stakes and holding ten poles while the grown-ups lift the tent up.\nBuilding a Campfire: If campfires are allowed at your campground, educate your children about how to build a campfire. Little children should not be allowed to handle a fire source, but they love gathering dry leaves and twigs for tinder and kindling material. Explain the importance of staying safe from the fire, never leaving it unattended, and extinguishing it completely when finished. Check out this blog post to learn more about how to build and maintain a campfire.\nCamping Etiquette: Teach your children about camping etiquette, such as respecting nature by not picking flowers, observing the wildlife from a safe distance and not feeding or disturbing animals, staying on designated trails to minimize their impact on fragile ecosystems, note leaving litter behind (leave no trace principles), and following campground rules, including observing the quiet hours. Explain the significance of protecting natural areas for future generations to enjoy. Instilling these values early will help raise responsible campers."

Here are some essential safety considerations:\n\nSupervision: Closely supervise your children, especially in potentially hazardous areas near the campfire or water sources (lake, sea/bay shore, or ponds). Keep a watchful eye to prevent accidents and address any concerns promptly.\nBug Protection: Protect your children from insect bites by using appropriate insect repellent and dressing them in long sleeves and pants, particularly during dawn and dusk when bugs are most active. For insect repellents, always check the strengths that can be used with children before leaving home. We prefer picaridin-based insect repellent.\nSun Protection: Apply sunscreen with a high SPF to shield your children from harmful UV rays. Ensure they wear hats and sunglasses for additional sun protection, especially on hot, sunny days.\nCampfire Safety: If you have a campfire, create a safe zone around it using rocks or a designated fire ring. Educate your children about the dangers of fire, and keep a bucket of water or a fire extinguisher nearby for emergencies."

These spontaneous moments often lead to the most cherished memories.\nPlan Rest Periods: Young children may need naps or rest breaks during the day. Plan for downtime in your camping schedule to ensure everyone stays well-rested and in good spirits.\nStay Open to Change: Weather conditions can change, and children’s moods can be unpredictable. Be prepared to adjust your plans, whether seeking shelter from rain, finding indoor activities, or changing mealtimes to accommodate hungry little ones."

One balmy morning in June, we set forth on the Western Ridge and Valley Trail Loop in the tranquil embrace of Rock Creek Park, Maryland. This scenic trail encompasses a 3.8-mile loop.\nAccessibility is a notable advantage, as this trail is easily reachable via public transportation. We opted for the Red Line metro, specifically the Van Ness station, which added an additional 2 miles to our hike. There is also a parking lot available at the trailhead with ample space.\nWe began our hike at the parking lots near the southernmost point, following a clockwise direction. Reflecting on it, I believe it was the right choice. Although the trail app I employ categorizes it as ‘easy,’ I would personally classify it as more ‘moderate.’ While the Western Ridge segment felt undemanding, the Valley Trail portion presented its share of challenges. At times, it narrows and abounds with tree roots to navigate.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nDuring our hike, we embarked on a side trail, which added an adventurous element. This path was narrow, winding, rocky, and covered with roots, making it somewhat precarious, especially given its proximity to a slope leading to the creek. A stumble or slip could be unsettling.\nThe hike featured several uphill sections and a few tricky spots in terms of footing in the latter half. We relied on our phones to stay on the trail, and even then, we had to adjust our course a few times. Along the way, we passed by a horse center, offering a unique opportunity to see horses on a city trail.\nIn sum, it was a pleasurable hike that commenced with a satisfying climb through the woods and offered enchanting river vistas in the second half. Remember to bring an ample supply of water, snacks, and bug spray to enhance your experience.\n\n\n\nWestern Ridge and Valley Trail Loop of Rock Creek Park\n\n\nTrail head map:\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Today, I’d like to share my recent adventure on the Capital Crescent Trail, a picturesque walking path that gracefully spans between two vibrant cities: Bethesda, Maryland, and Georgetown, Washington, D.C. This captivating trail extends over 7.0 miles, offering a point-to-point journey.\nOur chosen route led us from Bethesda to Georgetown, presenting a delightful downhill course. The trail itself boasts a level terrain, cherished by runners, hikers, and cycling enthusiasts alike. While the initial 2.5 miles can be bustling on weekends, teeming with bikers and walkers, it gradually gives way to a quieter and more secluded path. Along the way, intermittent views of a winding river that flows parallel to the trail unfold.\n\nWhat truly amazed us was the trail’s ability to maintain an oasis of tranquility amidst the urban surroundings, effectively drowning out the noise of city traffic. The three-hour trek to complete the trail left us exhausted but deeply fulfilled.\nOne of the trail’s distinct charms lies in the array of restaurants lining its trail heads. These proved to be a welcome sight for us, especially after a hearty meal at the first eatery we encountered.\n\nAccessibility to the trail is a breeze, with convenient public transportation options. Personally, I opted for the metro, traveling to Bethesda and then making my way to the trailhead. On the return journey, I disembarked at Rosslyn station, situated merely a mile from the trail’s conclusion.\nFor those who wish to customize their hiking experience, the trail is ingeniously designed with multiple entry points, offering ample parking facilities.

    "text": "Where to begin and how to gain access to a kayak?\nWhen you start, you may not want to buy a kayak. Kayaks are of multiple types, can be expensive, need storage space, and make arrangements to transport them to water. All these take some planning and investment. You also do not know if you would like it or want to continue it as a long-term hobby. If you are in Maryland or most states in the USA, you can rent a vessel during the boating season, usually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. However, without knowing a thing about propelling watercraft, you may be hesitant or uncomfortable if not in danger. Therefore, I recommend taking classes on kayaking in a group setting first. That is how I got into kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. Group classes are fun and have a low entry bar. Everyone is in the same boat (dad joke) and motivates each other. Various outdoorsy organizations, such as REI, conduct classes frequently throughout the year or as weather permits.\nI started kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding (SUP) by participating in classes organized by REI. The classes were conveniently located near my home, the instructors were terrific, and the REI provided all the necessary equipment, including a kayak, personal floatation device (PFD; life jacket), and accessories like dry bags for phones, car keys, etc. Lessons were long enough to get some practice time on the water but not overwhelming or physically straining. I did two classes, one for kayaking and the second for SUP, and my group comprised people from a wide age and fitness range.\nBesides beginner classes, REI also conducts tours of varying lengths and fitness requirements of popular attractions in nearby areas. For example, popular tours in Maryland are the Wye Island Kayak Tour, DC Monuments Kayak Tour, and Ghosts of the Potomac: Mallows Bay Kayak Tour. After doing a beginner class, a couple of such tours are an excellent way to practice while still being in a group and with experts who help you learn and rescue if needed. I highly recommend REI classes, tours, and other courses led by a professional organization in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese courses and tours will cost you some money, and I know for us Indians, especially those living in a foreign country, one of our primary goals is to save money. However, I encourage you to fork out a little money and gain these experiences while you still can, and trust me, it will be worth it. Do not wait for a friend who might give you a free lesson on a rental one day; those opportunities are hard to come by and are nothing compared to REI or similar classes."

    "text": "Still not ready to buy a kayak, but you want to continue\nEven after doing learn to kayak courses and going on a couple of guided tours, if you are still unsure if you should buy your kayak for financial, storage, or any other reasons - similar to me - but you still want to continue. Invest in water shoes, a life jacket, and clothing for water activities. In 2023, I was planning to buy an inflatable stand-up paddle board and kayak hybrid that I could easily store and haul in my Honda Civic, but for several reasons, I could not. So I decided to buy a life jacket that fit me well and had more features than the ones you get when you rent a boat. Those rental ones are basic and soaked in other people’s sweat, which I find gross, even for a few hours. In addition to my life jacket, I also own a pair of water shoes, boater’s gloves, a long-sleeved hooded shirt, a bucket hat, and a pair of convertible pants for my water activities.\nClean gear that fits you well makes the activity more efficient and comfortable. You could spend more time thinking about and practicing your paddling skills than the gross rental life jacket, water shoes, etc. It also makes you feel more invested in your hobby and will help you to sustain it longer.\nSome other accessories that I find helpful are a dry bag to keep my car keys, wallet, snack, bandana, and a phone cover with floatation to carry my phone around my neck to take photos. I like the flotation feature because a typical waterproof case can protect your phone from water, but it will sink if you drop it in the lake."

    "section": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a kayak",
    "text": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a kayak\nThere are several different types of kayaks, each designed for specific purposes and environments. Here are some of the most common types:\nTracking in kayaking refers to the kayak’s ability to maintain a straight course through the water without excessive veering or wandering off course. A kayak with good tracking capabilities will travel in a straight line when paddled, requiring less corrective effort from the paddler to keep it on course.\n\nRecreational Kayaks: These kayaks are ideal for beginners and casual paddlers. They are stable, easy to maneuver, and typically have a larger cockpit for easy entry and exit. Recreational kayaks are great for calm waters like lakes, slow rivers, and calm coastal areas.\nTouring Kayaks: Touring kayaks are designed for longer journeys and offer better tracking and efficiency in the water. They have more storage space for gear and are suitable for exploring larger bodies of water like lakes, bays, and coastal areas.\nSea Kayaks: Similar to touring kayaks, sea kayaks are designed for open waters, including oceans and rougher conditions. They have a longer hull and are often equipped with features like rudders or skegs to improve tracking and stability.\nSit-on-Top Kayaks: These kayaks have an open design where the paddler sits on top rather than inside a cockpit. They’re popular for recreational use, warm climates, and activities like fishing and snorkeling. They’re easy to get on and off and self-draining.\nInflatable Kayaks: Inflatable kayaks are portable and convenient, as they can be deflated and packed for easy transport. They are versatile and suitable for calm waters, making them a good option for those with limited storage space.\nWhitewater Kayaks: Designed for navigating swift rivers and whitewater rapids, whitewater kayaks are shorter and more maneuverable. They often have a lower volume and specialized features to handle the challenges of fast-moving water.\nPlayboats: Playboats are a type of whitewater kayak designed for performing tricks and maneuvers in waves and rapids. They are shorter and highly maneuverable, allowing kayakers to engage in freestyle moves.\nCrossover Kayaks: These kayaks aim to combine features from different types, making them versatile for various conditions. They might have the stability of a recreational kayak and the efficiency of a touring kayak, for example.\nFolding Kayaks: Folding kayaks are made from materials like fabric and metal frames, allowing them to be folded up and stored compactly. They’re great for adventurers who want to explore remote areas and have limited transportation options.\nSurf Skis: Surf skis are long, narrow kayaks designed for speed and efficiency in open water. They are often used in competitive paddling and are suitable for experienced kayakers.\n\nBefore choosing a kayak, consider your skill level, intended activities, and the type of waters you’ll be exploring. Each kayak type has its advantages and limitations, so it’s important to pick one that suits your preferences and needs.\n\nFeatures of a typical kayak\nA typical kayak has several key features contributing to its performance, stability, and functionality. Here are the main components you’ll find on most kayaks:\n\nHull: The hull is the bottom of the kayak that comes into contact with the water. It can be categorized into two main types: flat and rounded. Flat hulls offer more stability, while rounded hulls provide better maneuverability.\nCockpit: The cockpit is the opening where the kayaker sits. It can vary in size and shape depending on the type of kayak. Sit-on-top kayaks have an open cockpit, while traditional kayaks have a closed cockpit with a cover.\nDeck: The deck is the top surface of the kayak. It often features rigging, bungee cords, or straps to secure gear and accessories. On closed-cockpit kayaks, the deck also includes a hatch for storage.\nSeat: The seat provides comfort for the paddler during long journeys. Some kayaks have adjustable seats to accommodate different body sizes and paddling styles.\nFootrests or Foot Pegs: These adjustable footrests or pegs provide support for your feet and help you apply leverage for powerful paddle strokes.\nPaddle: The paddle is the key tool for propelling the kayak through the water. Paddle length and blade shape can vary based on the paddler’s height and intended use.\nBulkheads: Bulkheads are partitions inside the kayak that create separate storage compartments, typically in sea kayaks. They provide buoyancy and keep water out of the compartments.\nHatch Covers: Found on sea kayaks and touring kayaks, hatch covers to seal the storage compartments to keep gear dry and prevent water from entering.\nDeck Rigging: Bungee cords or straps on the deck are used to secure items like dry bags, water bottles, and other accessories.\nRudder or Skeg: These are features on some kayaks, particularly sea kayaks. A rudder is an adjustable fin at the stern that helps with steering in wind and currents, while a skeg is a fixed fin that aids tracking.\nGrab Handles: Handles located on the bow, stern, and sides of the kayak make it easier to transport the kayak to and from the water.\nThigh Braces: Thigh braces are padded areas inside the cockpit that provide contact points for your thighs, helping with control and stability.\nSpray Skirt: A spray skirt is used with closed cockpit kayaks to seal off the cockpit and prevent water from entering. It’s especially useful in rough conditions.\nPaddle Leash: A paddle leash secures your paddle to the kayak to prevent it from floating away if you accidentally drop it.\nSafety Lines: These lines run along the perimeter of the kayak and provide a handhold for assisted rescues and self-rescue techniques.\n\nThese features can vary based on the type of kayak and its intended use. Choosing a kayak with the right features for your skill level, preferred activities, and the water conditions you plan to encounter is important."

    "text": "Planning Your Trip\n\nChoose the Right Location\n\nCampgrounds vs. Primitive Sites: While campgrounds offer amenities like toilets, showers, on-site electrical outlets, and sometimes even Wi-Fi, primitive or dispersed camping sites give you solitude and a more rugged experience. I recommend state park-managed campgrounds with bathroom complexes in their campsite loop for beginners. We have booked electric and non-electric sites, but always with a bathroom complex in our loop. We have young kids, so we try to be as close to the bathroom complex as possible.\nRegulations: Always research any restrictions or requirements for camping in your chosen area. Most managed state/national park campgrounds require an advanced booking. On popular destinations or during peak seasons, they may also require minimum days of booking. Many campgrounds, for example, Maryland State Park campgrounds, do not allow alcohol on the premises and have restrictions on which sites can be used with pets. Many state parks also do not allow inter-state firewood transportation, so you will need to source your firewood from the camp store.\n\n\n\nMake a Checklist\nFrom cooking gear to bug spray, making a list ensures you don’t forget anything crucial. Essentials often include:\n\nTent and its components\nSleeping bags and pads or air mattresses\nCooking gear and food supplies\nClothing suitable for all weather conditions\nNavigation tools like maps or GPS\nFirst Aid Kit and bug spray\nLight sources: flashlights, lanterns, etc.\nCutting tools: knife, saw, axe, etc.\nCordage: paracord, banklines, etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out my previous article on Essentials for Outdoor Survival, which lists the essential items you might need in an outdoor survival situation. And here is the camping checklist by REI."

    "title": "Camping 101: The Ultimate Guide to Camping for Beginners",
    "section": "The Gear",
    "text": "The Gear\n\nChoosing a Tent\n\nSize: Pick a tent that offers enough space for everyone. A “four-person tent” may be cramped for four adults plus gear. However, it is generally okay for two adults and two kids. It is always better to consult experts at an outdoor fitter store like REI on the gear you might need based on the number of occupants and the place you are going. However, if you know what you are looking for, then the Facebook marketplace is an excellent option to score some used gear cheaply. I bought my one and four-person tents from the Facebook marketplace that were barely used and a quarter of the price.\nWeather: Your tent should be appropriate for the seasons you’ll be camping in, and this is where you need to spend more time researching or taking expert advice. Even if your tent is spacious enough for you and the gear, it may not hold even for 15 minutes in a downpour or get blown away easily. My one-person tent by Alps Mountaineering is sturdy enough to take a beating. However, my four-person Coleman Sundome budget tent gives away within 15 mins in a downpour. I still use it but with an additional tarp on it.\nEase of Setup: As a beginner, you might prefer a tent that’s easy to set up. But avoid buying those unbranded, easy-to-set-up pop-up tents from Amazon. They are cheaply made and flimsy and would not stand the slightest change in the weather.\n\n\n\nSleeping Essentials\n\nSleeping Bag: Choose one that’s suited for the climate. For a beginner camper, a three-season sleeping bag is ideal. It will allow you to camp from Spring to Fall in most places. You can get sleeping bags either with synthetic or down-filling material. Synthetic bas are cheaper, bulkier, but would still work when wet. Down sleeping bags are more expensive and lighter but usually are not as effective when wet unless the down is treated with water repellents. I have a Marmot Trestles Elite Eco 20° Sleeping Bag, which is a synthetic bag, but it’s only slightly heavier than an REI down bag, much cheaper, and is rated for three seasons. So, for three seasons of car camping, I have no complaints.\nSleeping Pad or Air Mattress: Essential for insulation and cushioning as you should never sleep directly on the tent floor. First, it’s not comfortable. Second, the campgrounds are colder than you might expect, removing all the warmth the sleeping bag provides.\n\n\n\nCooking and Food Storage\n\nStove: A simple propane/butane stove often works well for beginners. If you are with family, then go for a double-burner stove. Coleman has several models to suit your budget. Ozark Trail, a budget brand from Walmart, can also be a good beginner choice.\nCooler: Keeps perishables safe. Again, Coleman is a good budget option. The size of the cooler depends upon the number of people and meals that require the ingredients to be kept cold. We have a basic Coleman 70 qt cooler that I bought used from the Facebook marketplace, which serves us well for two nights. We usually keep eggs, bacon, milk (for the baby), frozen meats, soda, and juices in the cooler. For Ice, we freeze 300 ml plastic water bottles to form the bottom layer and put ice cubes in several zip-lock bags for the top. We also use reusable ice packs instead of ice cubes to avoid liquid spills once the ice melts. The advantage of using frozen water bottles is that there is no spillover after the ice melts, and you have drinkable water to use.\nCookware: Basic pots, pans, and utensils are usually sufficient. For car camping, you do not need those high-end lightweight titanium cookware. We took our home cookware when we went on our first camping. However, over time, we have made a separate set of stainless steel and cast iron cookware dedicated to camping, always stored in our camping tote. We use reusable plastic plates, cups, and cutlery - we avoid one-time use of paper plates or cups to minimize the trash. However, if you are a first-time camper, it might be overwhelming to organize, cook, and clean your cookware in the camp bathroom/wash station, so carrying a few paper plates, cups, and plastic utensils might be more manageable.\n\n\n\nTools, Light, and Fire Source\n\nCutting Tools: You must have a knife in your kitchen set. However, having a camp/bushcraft knife, such as a fixed blade full tang knife, is helpful in various situations like processing firewood, clearing vegetation, cutting cordage, etc.\nCordage: Your tent should come with guy lines along with stakes. However, if you also carry a tarp as an extra layer over your tent or cover the dining area, you would need additional cordage. Paracords are the most popular type of cordage used in camping. Inexpensive generic paracords from Dollar Tree are more than enough for non-load-bearing tasks such as hanging a tarp or clothesline.\nFlashlights and Lanterns: Campgrounds become pitch dark on a moonless night. Therefore, a dedicated flashlight is essential to move around your campsite or go to the bathroom complex. I prefer headlamps over handheld flashlights. I also bring a battery-operated or oil lantern for the general illumination of the campsite.\nFire Source: In your kitchen set, you must have a lighter for your propane stove. However, an alternative source, such as waterproof matches or a ferro rod, can be used as a backup."

    "section": "Setting Up Your Campsite",
    "text": "Setting Up Your Campsite\n\nTent Placement\n\nLevel Ground: Look for a flat and moisture-free area for your tent. If you are in a state park-managed campground, they usually have a tent pad filled with stone dust, which is good for keeping dry and providing a level surface. You can check if your campsite has a tent pad or know while making a booking. I have pitched tents on both tent pads and the ground and now I prefer tent pads. They can take in a lot of rain without getting muddy, making it cleaner to pack up the tent without spending too much time scrapping off the sticky goo.\nSafety: Ensure you’re not too close to a cliff edge, river, or other potential hazards. Again, if you are in a state park-managed campground, the campsites are designed to keep these things in mind. However, I try not to be very close to the river to avoid insects and water animals crawling in our campsite and avoiding the danger of kids running into the water.\nDistance: Keep a safe distance from your car’s exhaust to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning and the fire ring. You may need to run your car if you want to use it to charge your cell phones or use a pump to inflate your sleeping pad, etc. And sparklings from the campfire can burn a hole in your tent if not setting the whole thing on fire.\n\n\n\nKitchen Area\n\nFire Safety: For the similar reason to keep your tent away from the fire ring, keep the cooking area away from the tent.\nAccessibility: It should be easily accessible but not so close that it attracts animals to your sleeping area. It should not be tricky in a state park as the campsites are small and everything is within accessible range. However, since the picnic table - where you would probably set up your kitchen - is not too far from your tent, keeping it clean all the time is essential not to attract animals to your site.\n\n\n\nGeneral Tips\n\nFootprint: Consider laying a tarp under your tent for extra protection from moisture. You can buy a footprint specific to your tent model. However, they are expensive, and if you have a budget tent, then probably not worth it. I use cheap utility tarps from Dollar Tree as my tent footprint. They form an extra layer of moisture protection and prevent my tent from getting excessively dirty. And since they are cheap, I can throw them away if they get damaged or too dirty to bring back home.\nTent Stakes: Ensure they are securely in the ground to handle wind. I always stake down my tent even if there is no wind. You never know when the weather might change and blow away your tent.\nStorage: Use your car for secure storage, but remember to keep food in animal-proof containers in an area with wildlife."

Read the dosage strength before leaving home, especially for children. We also carry an alternative, such as citronella candles and mosquito-repellent coils, to burn in the dining and hangout area.\nWildlife: Store food, trash, and scented items such as toiletries properly to avoid attracting unwanted guests.
