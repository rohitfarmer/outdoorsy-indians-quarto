This year, I set my sights on exploring the trails nestled in the heart of the bustling cities within the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV area). A dear friend encouraged me to document these urban adventures through blogging, with the goal of offering fellow enthusiasts a glimpse into these distinctive hikes and trails.

On one wintry weekend, as part of my ongoing city exploration series, I embarked on the Melvin C. Hazen Trail. Nestled within the urban landscape, this trail offers a delightful slice of nature that has the uncanny ability to make you feel as though you've left the city far behind. The rustic trailhead can be found at Melvin C. Hazen Park, setting the stage for a captivating journey.

To make this experience even more immersive, we decided to rely on public transportation. Our starting point was the Cleveland Metro Station, conveniently located on the red line of the D.C. metro system. From there, we ventured northward to commence our adventure.

The Melvin C. Hazen Trail is a modest 1-mile out-and-back trail, adorned with several enchanting and easy stream crossings, facilitated by stepping stones and fallen trees. It's worth noting that during periods of elevated water levels, the stream may overflow, necessitating waterproof hiking shoes. Fortunately for us, this particular outing took place during the winter, sparing us from such concerns.

The trail is well-marked and falls under the category of easy hikes. While I hesitate to classify it as a true hike due to its relatively short distance, it offers a picturesque walk that effortlessly transports you away from the city bustle. It's an accessible escape into tranquility and nature.

Melvin C. Hazen Trail also enjoys a reputation as a haven for bird nesting and birdwatching. Thus, a return visit during the spring or summer promises to be a birdwatcher's paradise.

As part of my ongoing city exploration project, I'm gearing up to elevate the challenge by extending the journey to Rock Creek Park. Fortunately, the Melvin C. Hazen Trail conveniently provides access to the Rock Creek Trail, opening up exciting possibilities for future adventures. I invite you to stay tuned for further updates as I continue to uncover the hidden gems within our urban landscapes.
