Hiking, for me, offers a harmonious escape from the demands of daily life. One balmy morning in June, we set forth on the Western Ridge and Valley Trail Loop in the tranquil embrace of Rock Creek Park, Maryland. This scenic trail encompasses a 3.8-mile loop.

Accessibility is a notable advantage, as this trail is easily reachable via public transportation. We opted for the Red Line metro, specifically the Van Ness station, which added an additional 2 miles to our hike. There is also a parking lot available at the trailhead with ample space.

We began our hike at the parking lots near the southernmost point, following a clockwise direction. Reflecting on it, I believe it was the right choice. Although the trail app I employ categorizes it as 'easy,' I would personally classify it as more 'moderate.' While the Western Ridge segment felt undemanding, the Valley Trail portion presented its share of challenges. At times, it narrows and abounds with tree roots to navigate.

During our hike, we embarked on a side trail, which added an adventurous element. This path was narrow, winding, rocky, and covered with roots, making it somewhat precarious, especially given its proximity to a slope leading to the creek. A stumble or slip could be unsettling.

The hike featured several uphill sections and a few tricky spots in terms of footing in the latter half. We relied on our phones to stay on the trail, and even then, we had to adjust our course a few times. Along the way, we passed by a horse center, offering a unique opportunity to see horses on a city trail.

In sum, it was a pleasurable hike that commenced with a satisfying climb through the woods and offered enchanting river vistas in the second half. Remember to bring an ample supply of water, snacks, and bug spray to enhance your experience.
