</div>
<p>I come from Allahabad (now Prayagraj), UP, India, the home to two of India’s most prominent rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna. However, besides doing a couple of paid boating trips on the rivers, I never got any opportunity for water sports - it was just not there. No boat houses for boat rentals no lessons on kayaking or canoeing. I would argue that it’s the same in most places in India. We can participate in water activities as tourists in certain places, but I do not know anyone who does that as a hobby or sport.</p>
<p>I naturally get attracted to water, and my long-time desire was to get involved in water sports - any type. Fortunately, I moved to Maryland in 2019, opening doors for me to take up water activities as a hobby. In this article, I will talk about my experience starting as a complete beginner, having no paddling/rowing experience.</p>
<section id="where-to-begin-and-how-to-gain-access-to-a-kayak" class="level1">
<h1>Where to begin and how to gain access to a kayak?</h1>
<p>When you start, you may not want to buy a kayak. Kayaks are of multiple types, can be expensive, need storage space, and make arrangements to transport them to water. All these take some planning and investment. You also do not know if you would like it or want to continue it as a long-term hobby. If you are in Maryland or most states in the USA, you can rent a vessel during the boating season, usually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. However, without knowing a thing about propelling watercraft, you may be hesitant or uncomfortable if not in danger. Therefore, I recommend taking classes on kayaking in a group setting first. That is how I got into kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. Group classes are fun and have a low entry bar. Everyone is in the same boat (dad joke) and motivates each other. Various outdoorsy organizations, such as REI, conduct classes frequently throughout the year or as weather permits.</p>
<p>I started <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/5668/learn-to-kayak-class">kayaking</a> and <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/9390/learn-to-stand-up-paddleboard-class">stand-up paddle boarding (SUP)</a> by participating in classes organized by REI. The classes were conveniently located near my home, the instructors were terrific, and the REI provided all the necessary equipment, including a kayak, personal floatation device (PFD; life jacket), and accessories like dry bags for phones, car keys, etc. Lessons were long enough to get some practice time on the water but not overwhelming or physically straining. I did two classes, one for kayaking and the second for SUP, and my group comprised people from a wide age and fitness range.</p>
<p>Besides beginner classes, REI also conducts tours of varying lengths and fitness requirements of popular attractions in nearby areas. For example, popular tours in Maryland are the <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/57261/wye-island-kayak-tour">Wye Island Kayak Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/51817/dc-monuments-kayak-tour">DC Monuments Kayak Tour</a>, and <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/51859/ghosts-of-the-potomac-mallows-bay-kayak-tour">Ghosts of the Potomac: Mallows Bay Kayak Tour</a>. After doing a beginner class, a couple of such tours are an excellent way to practice while still being in a group and with experts who help you learn and rescue if needed. I highly recommend REI classes, tours, and other courses led by a professional organization in your area.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>These courses and tours will cost you some money, and I know for us Indians, especially those living in a foreign country, one of our primary goals is to save money. However, I encourage you to fork out a little money and gain these experiences while you still can, and trust me, it will be worth it. Do not wait for a friend who might give you a free lesson on a rental one day; those opportunities are hard to come by and are nothing compared to REI or similar classes.</p>

<section id="still-not-ready-to-buy-a-kayak-but-you-want-to-continue" class="level1">
<h1>Still not ready to buy a kayak, but you want to continue</h1>
<p>Even after doing learn to kayak courses and going on a couple of guided tours, if you are still unsure if you should buy your kayak for financial, storage, or any other reasons - similar to me - but you still want to continue. Invest in water shoes, a life jacket, and clothing for water activities. In 2023, I was planning to buy an inflatable stand-up paddle board and kayak hybrid that I could easily store and haul in my Honda Civic, but for several reasons, I could not. So I decided to buy a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/187431/astral-e-ronny-pfd-mens">life jacket</a> that fit me well and had more features than the ones you get when you rent a boat. Those rental ones are basic and soaked in other people’s sweat, which I find gross, even for a few hours. In addition to my life jacket, I also own a pair of <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/881347/nrs-kicker-remix-wetshoe-water-shoes-mens?redirect-pup=false">water shoes</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/188926/nrs-boaters-glove-mens?redirect-pup=false">boater’s gloves</a>, a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/185196/rei-co-op-sahara-shade-hoodie-mens?redirect-pup=false">long-sleeved hooded shirt</a>, a bucket hat, and a pair of <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/202030/rei-co-op-sahara-convertible-pants-mens">convertible pants</a> for my water activities.</p>
<p>Clean gear that fits you well makes the activity more efficient and comfortable. You could spend more time thinking about and practicing your paddling skills than the gross rental life jacket, water shoes, etc. It also makes you feel more invested in your hobby and will help you to sustain it longer.</p>
<p>Some other accessories that I find helpful are a <a href="https://a.co/d/gyEXzZ6">dry bag</a> to keep my car keys, wallet, snack, bandana, and a <a href="https://a.co/d/6A3BW0A">phone cover with floatation</a> to carry my phone around my neck to take photos. I like the flotation feature because a typical waterproof case can protect your phone from water, but it will sink if you drop it in the lake.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-you-want-to-take-the-plunge-and-buy-a-kayak" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>So, you want to take the plunge and buy a kayak</h1>
<p>There are several different types of kayaks, each designed for specific purposes and environments. Here are some of the most common types:</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class=""><strong>Tracking</strong> in kayaking refers to the kayak’s ability to maintain a straight course through the water without excessive veering or wandering off course. A kayak with good tracking capabilities will travel in a straight line when paddled, requiring less corrective effort from the paddler to keep it on course.</span></div></div>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Recreational Kayaks:</strong> These kayaks are ideal for beginners and casual paddlers. They are stable, easy to maneuver, and typically have a larger cockpit for easy entry and exit. Recreational kayaks are great for calm waters like lakes, slow rivers, and calm coastal areas.</li>
<li><strong>Touring Kayaks:</strong> Touring kayaks are designed for longer journeys and offer better tracking and efficiency in the water. They have more storage space for gear and are suitable for exploring larger bodies of water like lakes, bays, and coastal areas.</li>
<li><strong>Sea Kayaks:</strong> Similar to touring kayaks, sea kayaks are designed for open waters, including oceans and rougher conditions. They have a longer hull and are often equipped with features like rudders or skegs to improve tracking and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Sit-on-Top Kayaks:</strong> These kayaks have an open design where the paddler sits on top rather than inside a cockpit. They’re popular for recreational use, warm climates, and activities like fishing and snorkeling. They’re easy to get on and off and self-draining.</li>
<li><strong>Inflatable Kayaks:</strong> Inflatable kayaks are portable and convenient, as they can be deflated and packed for easy transport. They are versatile and suitable for calm waters, making them a good option for those with limited storage space.</li>
<li><strong>Whitewater Kayaks:</strong> Designed for navigating swift rivers and whitewater rapids, whitewater kayaks are shorter and more maneuverable. They often have a lower volume and specialized features to handle the challenges of fast-moving water.</li>
<li><strong>Playboats:</strong> Playboats are a type of whitewater kayak designed for performing tricks and maneuvers in waves and rapids. They are shorter and highly maneuverable, allowing kayakers to engage in freestyle moves.</li>
<li><strong>Crossover Kayaks:</strong> These kayaks aim to combine features from different types, making them versatile for various conditions. They might have the stability of a recreational kayak and the efficiency of a touring kayak, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Folding Kayaks:</strong> Folding kayaks are made from materials like fabric and metal frames, allowing them to be folded up and stored compactly. They’re great for adventurers who want to explore remote areas and have limited transportation options.</li>
<li><strong>Surf Skis:</strong> Surf skis are long, narrow kayaks designed for speed and efficiency in open water. They are often used in competitive paddling and are suitable for experienced kayakers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before choosing a kayak, consider your skill level, intended activities, and the type of waters you’ll be exploring. Each kayak type has its advantages and limitations, so it’s important to pick one that suits your preferences and needs.</p>
<section id="features-of-a-typical-kayak" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="features-of-a-typical-kayak">Features of a typical kayak</h2>
<p>A typical kayak has several key features contributing to its performance, stability, and functionality. Here are the main components you’ll find on most kayaks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hull:</strong> The hull is the bottom of the kayak that comes into contact with the water. It can be categorized into two main types: flat and rounded. Flat hulls offer more stability, while rounded hulls provide better maneuverability.</li>
<li><strong>Cockpit:</strong> The cockpit is the opening where the kayaker sits. It can vary in size and shape depending on the type of kayak. Sit-on-top kayaks have an open cockpit, while traditional kayaks have a closed cockpit with a cover.</li>
<li><strong>Deck:</strong> The deck is the top surface of the kayak. It often features rigging, bungee cords, or straps to secure gear and accessories. On closed-cockpit kayaks, the deck also includes a hatch for storage.</li>
<li><strong>Seat:</strong> The seat provides comfort for the paddler during long journeys. Some kayaks have adjustable seats to accommodate different body sizes and paddling styles.</li>
<li><strong>Footrests or Foot Pegs:</strong> These adjustable footrests or pegs provide support for your feet and help you apply leverage for powerful paddle strokes.</li>
<li><strong>Paddle:</strong> The paddle is the key tool for propelling the kayak through the water. Paddle length and blade shape can vary based on the paddler’s height and intended use.</li>
<li><strong>Bulkheads:</strong> Bulkheads are partitions inside the kayak that create separate storage compartments, typically in sea kayaks. They provide buoyancy and keep water out of the compartments.</li>
<li><strong>Hatch Covers:</strong> Found on sea kayaks and touring kayaks, hatch covers to seal the storage compartments to keep gear dry and prevent water from entering.</li>
<li><strong>Deck Rigging:</strong> Bungee cords or straps on the deck are used to secure items like dry bags, water bottles, and other accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Rudder or Skeg:</strong> These are features on some kayaks, particularly sea kayaks. A rudder is an adjustable fin at the stern that helps with steering in wind and currents, while a skeg is a fixed fin that aids tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Grab Handles:</strong> Handles located on the bow, stern, and sides of the kayak make it easier to transport the kayak to and from the water.</li>
<li><strong>Thigh Braces:</strong> Thigh braces are padded areas inside the cockpit that provide contact points for your thighs, helping with control and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Spray Skirt:</strong> A spray skirt is used with closed cockpit kayaks to seal off the cockpit and prevent water from entering. It’s especially useful in rough conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Paddle Leash:</strong> A paddle leash secures your paddle to the kayak to prevent it from floating away if you accidentally drop it.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Lines</strong>: These lines run along the perimeter of the kayak and provide a handhold for assisted rescues and self-rescue techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>These features can vary based on the type of kayak and its intended use. Choosing a kayak with the right features for your skill level, preferred activities, and the water conditions you plan to encounter is important.</p>

<p>Survival should not be the first thing to come to mind while thinking about the great outdoors - it should be fun, adventure, mesmerizing views, a star-filled night, the sound of a waterfall, encountering wildlife, and making memories with your loved ones. However, as soon as you step outside the comforts and protection of your house, you are subjected to the elements and unforeseen difficult situations. Therefore, heading out with some basic preparedness is always helpful, especially with a family, including small children. This post is inspired by the famous 5Cs of survivability and the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/10essentials.htm">ten essentials</a> by the National Park Services. And I hope these essential principles serve as your compass, guiding you through the rugged terrain and helping you emerge victorious in the face of nature’s trials.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>No matter how many survival tools you have in your pack, if you can call emergency services, for example, 911 in the US or 100 in India, do that first. Nothing is better than letting trained professionals take care of the situation. However, while waiting for help and rescue to arrive, you can take some measures to ease the situation, for example, administering first aid, making a shelter to protect from the weather, making fire to keep the victim and yourself warm, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="calmness-the-anchor-in-the-storm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calmness-the-anchor-in-the-storm">Calmness: the anchor in the storm</h2>
<p>First, if you are met with an unpleasant event, such as getting lost on the hiking trail or injured, do not panic. I know it’s harder done than said, and freaking out in the face of a disaster is natural - especially when your kids are involved. However, maintaining a sense of calmness is your greatest asset. Panic clouds judgment and impedes decision-making. Instead, take a deep breath and embrace the stillness within. Calmness allows you to assess your situation, consider your options, and formulate a rational plan. A calm mind can save your life even in the face of danger.</p>
</section>
<section id="first-aid-kit-treat-while-you-wait" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-aid-kit-treat-while-you-wait">First aid kit: treat while you wait</h2>
<p>A well-equipped first aid kit can be a lifesaver in any outdoor adventure. Accidents and injuries can happen unexpectedly, and being prepared with a first aid kit can make a significant difference in managing medical situations effectively. What a first aid kit should include depends on the nature of the activity and the people involved. Carrying a well-stocked first aid kit is a proactive step towards ensuring safety during outdoor expeditions. However, at a minimum, a good kit should include essential items like adhesive bandages, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes/creams, pain relievers, and any personal medications. Additionally, items such as a CAT tourniquet, splint materials, blister treatment, and compact emergency blankets are invaluable for addressing a variety of potential injuries.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="cutting-tools-for-crafting-and-survival" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cutting-tools-for-crafting-and-survival">Cutting: tools for crafting and survival</h2>
<p>A cutting tool, such as fixed blade knives, multitools, axes, and saws (all fall under this category), can make a significant difference in your attempt at survival. These tools can be used for opening a first aid kit, crafting shelter, procuring food, and processing wood for fire, amongst numerous other things. I always keep a small Swiss Army Knife in my car that goes to my day back or waist pack when I hit the trail or a park with kids. If needed, I also carry a bigger multitool with a plier and a small saw that adds more functionality without adding much weight to my pack. Besides multitools, a fixed blade full tang knife is essential while camping overnight. If you are car camping, you can carry all three. However, a fixed-blade knife would be more reliable while backpacking camping, especially for processing firewood.</p>
<p>While car camping, I carry an 11-inch foldable saw, a multitool, and a fixed-blade knife. When writing this post, I have not gone backpacking camping, so I am still determining what I will take. But it most likely is my Morakniv full-tang fixed blade knife.</p>
</section>
<section id="combustion-and-light-harnessing-the-power-of-fire" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combustion-and-light-harnessing-the-power-of-fire">Combustion and light: harnessing the power of fire</h2>
<p>Fire is a primal force that has been humanity’s ally for millennia. It provides warmth, light, a means to cook food, and a psychological boost in challenging times. In your survival kit, carry fire-starting tools like a box of matches (waterproof if possible), lighter, ferro rod, etc. Setting things up on fire is relatively easy. However, building a good fire for keeping warm for an extended period or cooking food can take some skills. Therefore, learning and practicing the fire building - from gathering tinder to kindler to fule and creating a sustainable blaze is helpful and fun. In the wilderness, fire is more than survival; it symbolizes resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>On day hikes, I usually carry a small Bic lighter; they hardly weigh and always work. I carry waterproof matches, Bic lighters (small and big), a Ferro rod, and some fire-starting cubes for car camping. Fire-starting cubes are excellent while camping. They are effortless and can reduce the burden of finding the right tinder and kindling material. I like to use them, especially on a cold morning when I want to get the fire going quickly, mostly on its own, while cooking my breakfast.</p>
<p>A campfire can keep you warm and cook your food, but it’s not luminous or portable enough to let you navigate the campsite, set up a shelter, or go to the bathroom. Therefore, you need a dedicated battery-operated light source, which could be as simple as your phone’s camera flash or a cheap flashlight from the Dollar Store or Walmart. However, having a headlamp is most versatile in its utility.</p>
</section>
<section id="cover-sheltering-yourself-from-the-elements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cover-sheltering-yourself-from-the-elements">Cover: sheltering yourself from the elements</h2>
<p>Proper clothing is your first line of defense against the harsh realities of the wilderness. Dressing appropriately for the environment is crucial to regulate body temperature and prevent hypothermia or heatstroke. Layering is critical, as it allows you to adjust to changing conditions. Sturdy, comfortable footwear is a must to navigate rugged terrain and prevent blisters. Remember, in the wild, your clothing is not just an outfit; it’s your shield against nature’s challenges.</p>
<p>Besides clothing, tarps (rain fly), ponchos (rain gear), and tents form the second line of defense against the elements. These cover options shield you from rain, wind, and sun, providing a safe haven to rest and regroup. Whether you are setting up a makeshift shelter or using a compact tent, having the means to create a protective barrier against the wild is essential.</p>
<p>Depending on the weather forecast, I carry a lightweight poncho on a day hike, which can also be spread on the ground to sit or lie down. If I am not carrying my multipurpose poncho, I carry a lightweight waterproof ground sheet/blanket for lying down. I do not carry tarps or tents on a day hike. However, while car camping with family, I carry several tarps for extra rain cover over our tent and cooking area and one emergency poncho for each family member.</p>
</section>
<section id="container-securing-vital-resources" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="container-securing-vital-resources">Container: securing vital resources</h2>
<p>A container – such as a water bottle – is handy for securing and transporting water. Water is paramount to survival, and having the means to collect and store it is non-negotiable. Containers can also be used to store edible plants, insects, or small game you might come across. Choose containers that are durable, leak-proof, and lightweight for easy portability.</p>
<p>For a short day hike, I usually carry two Smart (plastic) water bottles as they are lightweight, and I am not in danger of getting stranded for an extended period where I have to source water from my surroundings and purify it by boiling. However, if I am camping, I keep plastic water bottles/jugs as primary storage and a metal container, be it a water bottle (single-walled) or a kettle to boil the water. Of course, if you are backpacking, you will carry a kettle to boil the water for your ready-to-eat meals and coffee.</p>
<p>If you go to the beach, carry a double-walled insulated water bottle. It will add to the overall weight but keep your water cool even if you put it on the warm sand.</p>
</section>
<section id="cordage-your-versatile-lifeline" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cordage-your-versatile-lifeline">Cordage: your versatile lifeline</h2>
<p>Any type of heavy-duty or multi-purpose string falls under the category of cordage. From setting up shelter to crafting tools and traps, cordage is the lifeline that enables you to secure, tie, and create. Whether paracord, natural fibers, or improvised materials, having a good supply of cordage opens up a world of possibilities in the wild.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of paracords from Dollar Tree (25 ft) and Temu.com (100 ft) for setting up tarps over my tent and cooking area. I use the 100 ft cord for the tarp’s ridgeline and 25 ft cords for the guylines, and so far, they have reached even the most distant spread of trees around my campsites.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Paracords from Dollar Tree and Temu are cheap, but I would not trust them for critical load-bearing tasks. Even though they are sold as paracords, they do not have any load-bearing capacity rating. The rated 550 paracords should have a load-bearing capacity of 550 lbs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Besides paracords, I also use tarred nylon twine #18 from Walmart’s fishing equipment section. They are also called banklines, and the famous one is #36. Bank lines are much cheaper than paracords and useful for crafts where you want to cut the cord and probably leave it in the wild. I use bank lines to make prusik knots to tension my tarp on the ridgeline.</p>

<section id="communications-and-navigation-your-way-to-call-for-help-and-find-your-way-around" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communications-and-navigation-your-way-to-call-for-help-and-find-your-way-around">Communications and navigation: your way to call for help and find your way around</h2>
<p>I cannot move around in the USA without GPS on my phone, and probably it’s the same for you unless you have lived in the region for a very long time. Also, phone is the only quick way to call for help. Therefore, it goes without saying to keep the phone charged all the time with an active and sufficient calling and data plan. I also tend to download offline maps of the region I will be traveling to in case there is poor internet connectivity, which usually is many National Parks.</p>
<p>Besides Google Maps, I also install alternative navigation software that does not depend on the internet, such as OsmAnd+ or Organic Maps. I also recommend paper maps and a compass. However, I realize that only a few people can navigate using a paper map and a compass. It’s a skill worth taking up, and several outdoorsy organizations teach it, including your local REI store.</p>

<p>Since our mobile phones are such an integral part of our lives, in addition to keeping my phone in a sturdy phone case, I also carry a waterproof case with floatation that I can hang around my neck with lanyards while I am on the water either kayaking or stand up paddle boarding. Just keeping your phone in a waterproof casing is enough for the rain, but it will sink if it is dropped in the water. Therefore, a case with flotation capabilities is a must.</p>

<p>While camping (with family), we also carry cheap walkie-talkie radios that kids can use while going to the bathroom or playing near the campsite. Unlike cell phones, radios within range do not need internet or communication towers to work.</p>

<p>People say there is nothing called hygiene and counting calories while outdoors. However, getting sick while camping or returning home is not fun. Therefore, keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer. They are not heavy, and some hygiene won’t hurt.</p>
<p>Bugs are everywhere. You are invading their home, so they will not like it and might want to hurt you. So, insect repellents are a must. They protect you from the discomfort of insect bites and insect-borne diseases. Please check the recommended dosage and type of insect repellent for kids before heading out.</p>
<p>For bears, while camping or going on long hikes like in the Shenandoah National Parks, I always carry a bear spray can with me. However, before carrying a bear spray, check the park rules if they are allowed and learn how to use them before they are needed in action. Other nonchemical methods to deter a black bear, like a pressure horn or a jingle bell attached to your pack, let the bear know there are people around.</p>
<p>Beaches are not the only place you might need a splash of sunscreen. Depending upon where you are hiking, you might encounter long stretches of unshaded regions where you may need sun protection. Therefore, keep a small tube of sunscreen.</p>

<p>Surviving in the outdoors demands respect for nature’s power and a deep understanding of your capabilities. In this article, I aimed to list the categories of tools and skills that will empower you to navigate challenges, make sound decisions, and harness the resources around you to ensure you are ready to take care of any unpleasant events for yourself and your family while enjoying the great outdoors. You can choose one tool per category or multiple, depending on the activity and the people involved. I try to be extra prepared with family and keep backup tools per category.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article was to prepare and make you think about what you might need in an outdoor survival situation. It is not to scare you or get paranoid about every little detail. For most outdoor activities, we are not far from help; therefore, don’t get too carried away thinking about survival and miss the beauty and enjoyment of the great outdoors. Otherwise, that would be self-defeating.</p>
<p><strong>Now get on, and I might meet you on the trail!</strong></p>
