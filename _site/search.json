    "title": "A Beginner’s Guide to Camping",
    "section": "Planning Your Trip",
    "text": "Planning Your Trip\n\nChoose the Right Location\n\nCampgrounds vs. Primitive Sites: While campgrounds offer amenities like toilets, showers, on-site electrical outlets, and sometimes even Wi-Fi, primitive or dispersed camping sites give you solitude and a more rugged experience. I recommend state park-managed campgrounds with bathroom complexes in their campsite loop for beginners. We have booked electric and non-electric sites, but always with a bathroom complex in our loop. We have young kids, so we try to be as close to the bathroom complex as possible.\nRegulations: Always research any restrictions or requirements for camping in your chosen area. Most managed state/national park campgrounds require an advanced booking. On popular destinations or during peak seasons, they may also require minimum days of booking. Many campgrounds, for example, Maryland State Park campgrounds, do not allow alcohol on the premises and have restrictions on which sites can be used with pets. Many state parks also do not allow inter-state firewood transportation, so you will need to source your firewood from the camp store.\n\n\n\nMake a Checklist\nFrom cooking gear to bug spray, making a list ensures you don’t forget anything crucial. Essentials often include:\n\nTent and its components\nSleeping bags and pads or air mattresses\nCooking gear and food supplies\nClothing suitable for all weather conditions\nNavigation tools like maps or GPS\nFirst Aid Kit and bug spray\nLight sources: flashlights, lanterns, etc.\nCutting tools: knife, saw, axe, etc.\nCordage: paracord, banklines, etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out my previous article on Essentials for Outdoor Survival, which lists the essential items you might need in an outdoor survival situation. And here is the camping checklist by REI."

    "title": "A Beginner’s Guide to Camping",
    "section": "The Gear",
    "text": "The Gear\n\nChoosing a Tent\n\nSize: Pick a tent that offers enough space for everyone. A “four-person tent” may be cramped for four adults plus gear. However, it is generally okay for two adults and two kids. It is always better to consult experts at an outdoor fitter store like REI on the gear you might need based on the number of occupants and the place you are going. However, if you know what you are looking for, then the Facebook marketplace is an excellent option to score some used gear cheaply. I bought my one and four-person tents from the Facebook marketplace that were barely used and a quarter of the price.\nWeather: Your tent should be appropriate for the seasons you’ll be camping in, and this is where you need to spend more time researching or taking expert advice. Even if your tent is spacious enough for you and the gear, it may not hold even for 15 minutes in a downpour or get blown away easily. My one-person tent by Alps Mountaineering is sturdy enough to take a beating. However, my four-person Coleman Sundome budget tent gives away within 15 mins in a downpour. I still use it but with an additional tarp on it.\nEase of Setup: As a beginner, you might prefer a tent that’s easy to set up. But avoid buying those unbranded, easy-to-set-up pop-up tents from Amazon. They are cheaply made and flimsy and would not stand the slightest change in the weather.\n\n\n\nSleeping Essentials\n\nSleeping Bag: Choose one that’s suited for the climate. For a beginner camper, a three-season sleeping bag is ideal. It will allow you to camp from Spring to Fall in most places. You can get sleeping bags either with synthetic or down-filling material. Synthetic bas are cheaper, bulkier, but would still work when wet. Down sleeping bags are more expensive and lighter but usually are not as effective when wet unless the down is treated with water repellents. I have a Marmot Trestles Elite Eco 20° Sleeping Bag, which is a synthetic bag, but it’s only slightly heavier than an REI down bag, much cheaper, and is rated for three seasons. So, for three seasons of car camping, I have no complaints.\nSleeping Pad or Air Mattress: Essential for insulation and cushioning as you should never sleep directly on the tent floor. First, it’s not comfortable. Second, the campgrounds are colder than you might expect, removing all the warmth the sleeping bag provides.\n\n\n\nCooking and Food Storage\n\nStove: A simple propane/butane stove often works well for beginners. If you are with family, then go for a double-burner stove. Coleman has several models to suit your budget. Ozark Trail, a budget brand from Walmart, can also be a good beginner choice.\nCooler: Keeps perishables safe. Again, Coleman is a good budget option. The size of the cooler depends upon the number of people and meals that require the ingredients to be kept cold. We have a basic Coleman 70 qt cooler that I bought used from the Facebook marketplace, which serves us well for two nights. We usually keep eggs, bacon, milk (for the baby), frozen meats, soda, and juices in the cooler. For Ice, we freeze 300 ml plastic water bottles to form the bottom layer and put ice cubes in several zip-lock bags for the top. We also use reusable ice packs instead of ice cubes to avoid liquid spills once the ice melts. The advantage of using frozen water bottles is that there is no spillover after the ice melts, and you have drinkable water to use.\nCookware: Basic pots, pans, and utensils are usually sufficient. For car camping, you do not need those high-end lightweight titanium cookware. We took our home cookware when we went on our first camping. However, over time, we have made a separate set of stainless steel and cast iron cookware dedicated to camping, always stored in our camping tote. We use reusable plastic plates, cups, and cutlery - we avoid one-time use of paper plates or cups to minimize the trash. However, if you are a first-time camper, it might be overwhelming to organize, cook, and clean your cookware in the camp bathroom/wash station, so carrying a few paper plates, cups, and plastic utensils might be more manageable.\n\n\n\nTools, Light, and Fire Source\n\nCutting Tools: You must have a knife in your kitchen set. However, having a camp/bushcraft knife, such as a fixed blade full tang knife, is helpful in various situations like processing firewood, clearing vegetation, cutting cordage, etc.\nCordage: Your tent should come with guy lines along with stakes. However, if you also carry a tarp as an extra layer over your tent or cover the dining area, you would need additional cordage. Paracords are the most popular type of cordage used in camping. Inexpensive generic paracords from Dollar Tree are more than enough for non-load-bearing tasks such as hanging a tarp or clothesline.\nFlashlights and Lanterns: Campgrounds become pitch dark on a moonless night. Therefore, a dedicated flashlight is essential to move around your campsite or go to the bathroom complex. I prefer headlamps over handheld flashlights. I also bring a battery-operated or oil lantern for the general illumination of the campsite.\nFire Source: In your kitchen set, you must have a lighter for your propane stove. However, an alternative source, such as waterproof matches or a ferro rod, can be used as a backup."

    "title": "A Beginner’s Guide to Camping",
    "section": "Setting Up Your Campsite",
    "text": "Setting Up Your Campsite\n\nTent Placement\n\nLevel Ground: Look for a flat and moisture-free area for your tent. If you are in a state park-managed campground, they usually have a tent pad filled with stone dust, which is good for keeping dry and providing a level surface. You can check if your campsite has a tent pad or know while making a booking. I have pitched tents on both tent pads and the ground and now I prefer tent pads. They can take in a lot of rain without getting muddy, making it cleaner to pack up the tent without spending too much time scrapping off the sticky goo.\nSafety: Ensure you’re not too close to a cliff edge, river, or other potential hazards. Again, if you are in a state park-managed campground, the campsites are designed to keep these things in mind. However, I try not to be very close to the river to avoid insects and water animals crawling in our campsite and avoiding the danger of kids running into the water.\nDistance: Keep a safe distance from your car’s exhaust to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning and the fire ring. You may need to run your car if you want to use it to charge your cell phones or use a pump to inflate your sleeping pad, etc. And sparklings from the campfire can burn a hole in your tent if not setting the whole thing on fire.\n\n\n\nKitchen Area\n\nFire Safety: For the similar reason to keep your tent away from the fire ring, keep the cooking area away from the tent.\nAccessibility: It should be easily accessible but not so close that it attracts animals to your sleeping area. It should not be tricky in a state park as the campsites are small and everything is within accessible range. However, since the picnic table - where you would probably set up your kitchen - is not too far from your tent, keeping it clean all the time is essential not to attract animals to your site.\n\n\n\nGeneral Tips\n\nFootprint: Consider laying a tarp under your tent for extra protection from moisture. You can buy a footprint specific to your tent model. However, they are expensive, and if you have a budget tent, then probably not worth it. I use cheap utility tarps from Dollar Tree as my tent footprint. They form an extra layer of moisture protection and prevent my tent from getting excessively dirty. And since they are cheap, I can throw them away if they get damaged or too dirty to bring back home.\nTent Stakes: Ensure they are securely in the ground to handle wind. I always stake down my tent even if there is no wind. You never know when the weather might change and blow away your tent.\nStorage: Use your car for secure storage, but remember to keep food in animal-proof containers in an area with wildlife."

Read the dosage strength before leaving home, especially for children. We also carry an alternative, such as citronella candles and mosquito-repellent coils, to burn in the dining and hangout area.\nWildlife: Store food, trash, and scented items such as toiletries properly to avoid attracting unwanted guests.

    "text": "That’s me in my first learn to kayak class by REI at the Seneca Creek State Park, Gaithersburg, MD, USA\nI come from Allahabad (now Prayagraj), UP, India, the home to two of India’s most prominent rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna. However, besides doing a couple of paid boating trips on the rivers, I never got any opportunity for water sports - it was just not there. No boat houses for boat rentals no lessons on kayaking or canoeing. I would argue that it’s the same in most places in India. We can participate in water activities as tourists in certain places, but I do not know anyone who does that as a hobby or sport.\nI naturally get attracted to water, and my long-time desire was to get involved in water sports - any type. Fortunately, I moved to Maryland in 2019, opening doors for me to take up water activities as a hobby. In this article, I will talk about my experience starting as a complete beginner, having no paddling/rowing experience."

    "text": "Where to begin and how to gain access to a kayak?\nWhen you start, you may not want to buy a kayak. Kayaks are of multiple types, can be expensive, need storage space, and make arrangements to transport them to water. All these take some planning and investment. You also do not know if you would like it or want to continue it as a long-term hobby. If you are in Maryland or most states in the USA, you can rent a vessel during the boating season, usually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. However, without knowing a thing about propelling watercraft, you may be hesitant or uncomfortable if not in danger. Therefore, I recommend taking classes on kayaking in a group setting first. That is how I got into kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. Group classes are fun and have a low entry bar. Everyone is in the same boat (dad joke) and motivates each other. Various outdoorsy organizations, such as REI, conduct classes frequently throughout the year or as weather permits.\nI started kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding (SUP) by participating in classes organized by REI. The classes were conveniently located near my home, the instructors were terrific, and the REI provided all the necessary equipment, including a kayak, personal floatation device (PFD; life jacket), and accessories like dry bags for phones, car keys, etc. Lessons were long enough to get some practice time on the water but not overwhelming or physically straining. I did two classes, one for kayaking and the second for SUP, and my group comprised people from a wide age and fitness range.\nBesides beginner classes, REI also conducts tours of varying lengths and fitness requirements of popular attractions in nearby areas. For example, popular tours in Maryland are the Wye Island Kayak Tour, DC Monuments Kayak Tour, and Ghosts of the Potomac: Mallows Bay Kayak Tour. After doing a beginner class, a couple of such tours are an excellent way to practice while still being in a group and with experts who help you learn and rescue if needed. I highly recommend REI classes, tours, and other courses led by a professional organization in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese courses and tours will cost you some money, and I know for us Indians, especially those living in a foreign country, one of our primary goals is to save money. However, I encourage you to fork out a little money and gain these experiences while you still can, and trust me, it will be worth it. Do not wait for a friend who might give you a free lesson on a rental one day; those opportunities are hard to come by and are nothing compared to REI or similar classes."

    "text": "Still not ready to buy a kayak, but you want to continue\nEven after doing learn to kayak courses and going on a couple of guided tours, if you are still unsure if you should buy your kayak for financial, storage, or any other reasons - similar to me - but you still want to continue. Invest in water shoes, a life jacket, and clothing for water activities. In 2023, I was planning to buy an inflatable stand-up paddle board and kayak hybrid that I could easily store and haul in my Honda Civic, but for several reasons, I could not. So I decided to buy a life jacket that fit me well and had more features than the ones you get when you rent a boat. Those rental ones are basic and soaked in other people’s sweat, which I find gross, even for a few hours. In addition to my life jacket, I also own a pair of water shoes, boater’s gloves, a long-sleeved hooded shirt, a bucket hat, and a pair of convertible pants for my water activities.\nClean gear that fits you well makes the activity more efficient and comfortable. You could spend more time thinking about and practicing your paddling skills than the gross rental life jacket, water shoes, etc. It also makes you feel more invested in your hobby and will help you to sustain it longer.\nSome other accessories that I find helpful are a dry bag to keep my car keys, wallet, snack, bandana, and a phone cover with floatation to carry my phone around my neck to take photos. I like the flotation feature because a typical waterproof case can protect your phone from water, but it will sink if you drop it in the lake."

    "section": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a kayak",
    "text": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a kayak\nThere are several different types of kayaks, each designed for specific purposes and environments. Here are some of the most common types:\nTracking in kayaking refers to the kayak’s ability to maintain a straight course through the water without excessive veering or wandering off course. A kayak with good tracking capabilities will travel in a straight line when paddled, requiring less corrective effort from the paddler to keep it on course.\n\nRecreational Kayaks: These kayaks are ideal for beginners and casual paddlers. They are stable, easy to maneuver, and typically have a larger cockpit for easy entry and exit. Recreational kayaks are great for calm waters like lakes, slow rivers, and calm coastal areas.\nTouring Kayaks: Touring kayaks are designed for longer journeys and offer better tracking and efficiency in the water. They have more storage space for gear and are suitable for exploring larger bodies of water like lakes, bays, and coastal areas.\nSea Kayaks: Similar to touring kayaks, sea kayaks are designed for open waters, including oceans and rougher conditions. They have a longer hull and are often equipped with features like rudders or skegs to improve tracking and stability.\nSit-on-Top Kayaks: These kayaks have an open design where the paddler sits on top rather than inside a cockpit. They’re popular for recreational use, warm climates, and activities like fishing and snorkeling. They’re easy to get on and off and self-draining.\nInflatable Kayaks: Inflatable kayaks are portable and convenient, as they can be deflated and packed for easy transport. They are versatile and suitable for calm waters, making them a good option for those with limited storage space.\nWhitewater Kayaks: Designed for navigating swift rivers and whitewater rapids, whitewater kayaks are shorter and more maneuverable. They often have a lower volume and specialized features to handle the challenges of fast-moving water.\nPlayboats: Playboats are a type of whitewater kayak designed for performing tricks and maneuvers in waves and rapids. They are shorter and highly maneuverable, allowing kayakers to engage in freestyle moves.\nCrossover Kayaks: These kayaks aim to combine features from different types, making them versatile for various conditions. They might have the stability of a recreational kayak and the efficiency of a touring kayak, for example.\nFolding Kayaks: Folding kayaks are made from materials like fabric and metal frames, allowing them to be folded up and stored compactly. They’re great for adventurers who want to explore remote areas and have limited transportation options.\nSurf Skis: Surf skis are long, narrow kayaks designed for speed and efficiency in open water. They are often used in competitive paddling and are suitable for experienced kayakers.\n\nBefore choosing a kayak, consider your skill level, intended activities, and the type of waters you’ll be exploring. Each kayak type has its advantages and limitations, so it’s important to pick one that suits your preferences and needs.\n\nFeatures of a typical kayak\nA typical kayak has several key features contributing to its performance, stability, and functionality. Here are the main components you’ll find on most kayaks:\n\nHull: The hull is the bottom of the kayak that comes into contact with the water. It can be categorized into two main types: flat and rounded. Flat hulls offer more stability, while rounded hulls provide better maneuverability.\nCockpit: The cockpit is the opening where the kayaker sits. It can vary in size and shape depending on the type of kayak. Sit-on-top kayaks have an open cockpit, while traditional kayaks have a closed cockpit with a cover.\nDeck: The deck is the top surface of the kayak. It often features rigging, bungee cords, or straps to secure gear and accessories. On closed-cockpit kayaks, the deck also includes a hatch for storage.\nSeat: The seat provides comfort for the paddler during long journeys. Some kayaks have adjustable seats to accommodate different body sizes and paddling styles.\nFootrests or Foot Pegs: These adjustable footrests or pegs provide support for your feet and help you apply leverage for powerful paddle strokes.\nPaddle: The paddle is the key tool for propelling the kayak through the water. Paddle length and blade shape can vary based on the paddler’s height and intended use.\nBulkheads: Bulkheads are partitions inside the kayak that create separate storage compartments, typically in sea kayaks. They provide buoyancy and keep water out of the compartments.\nHatch Covers: Found on sea kayaks and touring kayaks, hatch covers to seal the storage compartments to keep gear dry and prevent water from entering.\nDeck Rigging: Bungee cords or straps on the deck are used to secure items like dry bags, water bottles, and other accessories.\nRudder or Skeg: These are features on some kayaks, particularly sea kayaks. A rudder is an adjustable fin at the stern that helps with steering in wind and currents, while a skeg is a fixed fin that aids tracking.\nGrab Handles: Handles located on the bow, stern, and sides of the kayak make it easier to transport the kayak to and from the water.\nThigh Braces: Thigh braces are padded areas inside the cockpit that provide contact points for your thighs, helping with control and stability.\nSpray Skirt: A spray skirt is used with closed cockpit kayaks to seal off the cockpit and prevent water from entering. It’s especially useful in rough conditions.\nPaddle Leash: A paddle leash secures your paddle to the kayak to prevent it from floating away if you accidentally drop it.\nSafety Lines: These lines run along the perimeter of the kayak and provide a handhold for assisted rescues and self-rescue techniques.\n\nThese features can vary based on the type of kayak and its intended use. Choosing a kayak with the right features for your skill level, preferred activities, and the water conditions you plan to encounter is important."

    "text": "Capital Crescent Trail\n\n\nIn the midst of the bustling urban life, I often seek solace and refuge in the serene embrace of nature during my hikes. Today, I’d like to share my recent adventure on the Capital Crescent Trail, a picturesque walking path that gracefully spans between two vibrant cities: Bethesda, Maryland, and Georgetown, Washington, D.C. This captivating trail extends over 7.0 miles, offering a point-to-point journey.\nOur chosen route led us from Bethesda to Georgetown, presenting a delightful downhill course. The trail itself boasts a level terrain, cherished by runners, hikers, and cycling enthusiasts alike. While the initial 2.5 miles can be bustling on weekends, teeming with bikers and walkers, it gradually gives way to a quieter and more secluded path. Along the way, intermittent views of a winding river that flows parallel to the trail unfold.\n\nWhat truly amazed us was the trail’s ability to maintain an oasis of tranquility amidst the urban surroundings, effectively drowning out the noise of city traffic. The three-hour trek to complete the trail left us exhausted but deeply fulfilled.\nOne of the trail’s distinct charms lies in the array of restaurants lining its trail heads. These proved to be a welcome sight for us, especially after a hearty meal at the first eatery we encountered.\n\nAccessibility to the trail is a breeze, with convenient public transportation options. Personally, I opted for the metro, traveling to Bethesda and then making my way to the trailhead. On the return journey, I disembarked at Rosslyn station, situated merely a mile from the trail’s conclusion.\nFor those who wish to customize their hiking experience, the trail is ingeniously designed with multiple entry points, offering ample parking facilities. It’s an adventure that beckons a return visit—a prospect I eagerly anticipate in the rich tapestry of city life.\nTrail Map\n\n\nFollow Swati Gaikwad on Instagram and witness her fantastic journey in the outdoors.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Where to begin and how to gain access to a SUP?\nWhen you start, you may not want to buy a SUP. SUPs, even though they have a smaller footprint than kayaks, are also of multiple types, can be expensive, need storage space, and make arrangements to transport them to water. All these take some planning and investment. You also do not know if you would like it or want to continue it as a long-term hobby. If you are in Maryland or most states in the USA, you can rent SUPs during the boating season, usually from Memorial Day to Labor Day. However, before heading out on your own on a rented SUP, I recommend first taking lessons in a group setting. It’s safer and will set you on the right path to explore further. Group classes are fun and have a low entry bar. Everyone is in the same boat (data joke) and motivates each other. Various outdoorsy organizations, such as REI, conduct classes frequently throughout the year or as weather permits.\nI started standup paddleboarding and kayaking by participating in classes organized by REI. The classes were conveniently located near my home, the instructors were terrific, and the REI provided all the necessary equipment, including a SUP, personal floatation device (PFD; life jacket), and accessories like dry bags for phones, car keys, etc. Lessons were long enough to get some practice time on the water but not overwhelming or physically straining. I did two classes, one for SUP and the second for kayaking, and my group comprised people from a wide age and fitness range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese courses and tours will cost you some money, and I know for us Indians, especially those living in a foreign country, one of our primary goals is to save money. However, I encourage you to fork out a little money and gain these experiences while you still can, and trust me, it will be worth it. Do not wait for a friend who might give you a free lesson on a rental one day; those opportunities are hard to come by and are nothing compared to REI or similar classes.\n\n\n\nEssentials\n\nBefore hitting the water, you’ll need to gather the essential equipment:\n\nPaddleboard: Choose a stable and beginner-friendly board. Wider and longer boards are generally more stable, making them ideal for beginners.\nPaddle: Ensure you have a correctly sized paddle that suits your height.\nPersonal Flotation Device (PFD): Safety first! Always wear a PFD when paddleboarding, especially if you’re not a confident swimmer.\nLeash: A leash connects you to your board, preventing it from drifting away if you fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nREI provides all the essential equipment if you join one of their classes. Most rental facilities also provide at least the PFD with the paddleboard. I have had experience of not getting a leash with a few rentals. If you are a beginner, it’s crucial to have a leash.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the Right Location\nSelecting the right location is crucial for a positive SUP experience. As a beginner, opt for calm, flatwater areas like:\n\nLakes\nSlow-moving rivers\nPonds\nSheltered bays\n\nAvoid strong currents, heavy boat traffic, and rough waves until you’ve gained more experience.\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nSafety should be your top priority. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind:\n\nCheck the weather forecast and wind conditions before heading out.\nWear sunscreen and appropriate clothing, considering weather and water temperature.\nFamiliarize yourself with local regulations and waterway rules.\nLet someone know your paddleboarding plans and estimated return time.\nPractice falling and remounting your board in a controlled environment."

    "text": "Still not ready to buy a SUP, but you want to continue\nEven after doing the “learn to standup paddleboard” class and a couple of rentals, if you are still unsure if you should buy your SUP for financial, storage, or any other reasons - similar to me - but you still want to continue. Invest in water shoes, a life jacket, and clothing for water activities. In 2023, I was planning to buy an inflatable standup paddle board and kayak hybrid that I could easily store and transport in my Honda Civic, but for several reasons, I could not. So I decided to buy a life jacket that fit me well and had more features than the ones you get when you rent a boat. Those rental ones are basic and soaked in other people’s sweat, which I find gross, even for a few hours. In addition to my life jacket, I also own a pair of water shoes, boater’s gloves, a long-sleeved hooded shirt, a bucket hat, and a pair of convertible pants for my water activities.\nClean gear that fits you well makes the activity more efficient and comfortable. You could spend more time thinking about and practicing your paddling skills than the gross rental life jacket, etc. It also makes you feel more invested in your hobby and will help you to sustain it longer.\nSome other accessories that I find helpful are a dry bag to keep my car keys, wallet, snack, bandana, and a phone cover with floatation to carry my phone around my neck to take photos. I like the flotation feature because a typical waterproof case can protect your phone from water, but it will sink if you drop it in the lake."

    "section": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a SUP",
    "text": "So, you want to take the plunge and buy a SUP\nStandup paddleboarding (SUP) has gained popularity over the years, leading to various paddle boards designed to suit different activities and conditions. Here are some of the main types of standup paddle boards:\n\nAll-Around/Touring Boards: These are versatile boards suitable for various conditions, making them great for beginners. They’re stable, maneuverable, and can be used on calm water, small waves, and light touring.\nSurf SUPs: Explicitly designed for surfing, these boards are shorter and more maneuverable. They are often narrower and have a rocker (upward curve) in the nose and tail, allowing them to handle waves effectively.\nFlatwater/Race Boards: These boards are long and narrow, built for speed and efficiency on flat water. They have a pointed nose and a displacement hull design that helps them slice through the water more smoothly.\nInflatable SUPs (iSUPs): These boards are made from durable, lightweight materials that can be inflated and deflated. They are great for portability and storage. Inflatable SUPs come in various styles, including all-around, touring, and racing.\nYoga/Fitness SUPs: These boards are wide, stable, and designed with a soft top for comfort. They provide a stable platform for practicing yoga, fitness routines, and other on-water exercises.\nFishing SUPs: These boards have features like extra stability, attachment points for fishing gear, and storage compartments. They’re designed for anglers who want to combine SUP with fishing.\nWhitewater SUPs: Built to handle river currents and rapids, whitewater SUPs are typically shorter, wider, and more robust to withstand the challenges of fast-moving water.\nWind SUPs: These boards can attach a sail, allowing you to use wind power for propulsion. They’re designed for those who want to combine paddleboarding with windsurfing.\nCruiser/Touring SUPs: Similar to touring boards, these SUPs are designed for longer-distance paddling and exploration. They often have additional attachment points for gear and are optimized for stability and tracking.\nKids’ SUPs: Smaller, lighter boards designed for children. They provide a safe and fun introduction to paddleboarding for younger enthusiasts.\nMulti-Person SUPs: These oversized boards are designed to accommodate more than one paddler. They’re great for family outings or group activities.\n\nWhen choosing a standup paddleboard, consider your skill level, the type of water you’ll be using it on (calm lakes, rivers, ocean waves), and the activities you want to engage in (touring, surfing, fitness, etc.). Board size, shape, volume, and construction materials are important factors. Testing different types of SUPs or seeking advice from experienced paddleboarders before purchasing is a good idea.\n\nFeatures of a typical SUP\nA typical standup paddleboard (SUP) comprises various components and features contributing to its design, performance, and functionality. Here are the key features you’ll find on most SUPs:\n\nDeck Pad: The deck pad is the cushioned area where you stand at the top of the board. It provides traction, comfort, and grip, helping you maintain balance and control.\nCarry Handle: A sturdy handle located in the center of the board makes it easier to carry the SUP to and from the water. Some boards may have multiple handles for different carrying options.\nTie-Down Points: These are attachment points on the board’s surface where you can secure gear, such as a dry bag, cooler, or fishing equipment, using bungee cords or straps.\nLeash Attachment: A leash attachment point is typically located at the back of the board, allowing you to secure the leash to your ankle or calf. This prevents the board from drifting away if you fall off.\nFin System: SUPs have fins that help with stability, tracking (maintaining a straight line), and maneuverability. The number and configuration of fins vary; some boards have a single center fin, while others have multiple fins.\nNose and Tail: The board’s front (nose) and back (tail) have different shapes and designs depending on the board’s intended use. For example, surf SUPs have a more pointed nose for better wave performance, while touring boards have a rounder nose for better stability and tracking.\nRails: Rails are the edges of the board that come into contact with the water. They can be soft or hard, rounded or sharp, and affect the board’s stability and maneuverability in different conditions.\nVolume and Thickness: The volume and thickness of a board affect its buoyancy and stability. Boards with more volume are more stable but can be slower, while boards with less volume are more maneuverable.\nConstruction Material: SUPs can be made from various materials, including foam, fiberglass, epoxy, carbon fiber, and inflatable PVC. Each material has its weight, durability, performance, and cost characteristics.\nDeck Bungee System: Some boards, especially touring and all-around models, have a deck bungee system that provides additional storage space on the front of the board. This is useful for securing items like a life jacket or a dry bag.\nRocker: The rocker refers to the curvature of the board from nose to tail. More rocker makes the board more maneuverable, while less rocker enhances speed and tracking.\nTail Shape: Different tail shapes, such as square, pintail, or swallowtail, impact the board’s turning ability and stability.\nVent Plug: Inflatable SUPs and some hard boards have a vent plug that allows air to escape and prevent damage from temperature changes or pressure.\nGraphics and Design: SUPs come in various colors, patterns, and graphics. While this doesn’t affect performance, it can add personalization and style to your board.\n\nRemember that the specific features of an SUP can vary based on the type of board, manufacturer, and intended use. Choosing a board that suits your skill level, preferred activities, and the conditions you’ll be paddling in is essential."

However, as soon as you step outside the comforts and protection of your house, you are subjected to the elements and unforeseen difficult situations. Therefore, heading out with some basic preparedness is always helpful, especially with a family, including small children. This post is inspired by the famous 5Cs of survivability and the ten essentials by the National Park Services. And I hope these essential principles serve as your compass, guiding you through the rugged terrain and helping you emerge victorious in the face of nature’s trials."

I know it’s harder done than said, and freaking out in the face of a disaster is natural - especially when your kids are involved. However, maintaining a sense of calmness is your greatest asset. Panic clouds judgment and impedes decision-making. Instead, take a deep breath and embrace the stillness within. Calmness allows you to assess your situation, consider your options, and formulate a rational plan. A calm mind can save your life even in the face of danger."

Carrying a well-stocked first aid kit is a proactive step towards ensuring safety during outdoor expeditions. However, at a minimum, a good kit should include essential items like adhesive bandages, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes/creams, pain relievers, and any personal medications. Additionally, items such as a CAT tourniquet, splint materials, blister treatment, and compact emergency blankets are invaluable for addressing a variety of potential injuries."

These tools can be used for opening a first aid kit, crafting shelter, procuring food, and processing wood for fire, amongst numerous other things. I always keep a small Swiss Army Knife in my car that goes to my day back or waist pack when I hit the trail or a park with kids. If needed, I also carry a bigger multitool with a plier and a small saw that adds more functionality without adding much weight to my pack. Besides multitools, a fixed blade full tang knife is essential while camping overnight. If you are car camping, you can carry all three. However, a fixed-blade knife would be more reliable while backpacking camping, especially for processing firewood.\nWhile car camping, I carry an 11-inch foldable saw, a multitool, and a fixed-blade knife. When writing this post, I have not gone backpacking camping, so I am still determining what I will take. But it most likely is my Morakniv full-tang fixed blade knife."

    "text": "Combustion and light: harnessing the power of fire\nFire is a primal force that has been humanity’s ally for millennia. It provides warmth, light, a means to cook food, and a psychological boost in challenging times. In your survival kit, carry fire-starting tools like a box of matches (waterproof if possible), lighter, ferro rod, etc. Setting things up on fire is relatively easy. However, building a good fire for keeping warm for an extended period or cooking food can take some skills. Therefore, learning and practicing the fire building - from gathering tinder to kindler to fule and creating a sustainable blaze is helpful and fun. In the wilderness, fire is more than survival; it symbolizes resilience and adaptability.\nOn day hikes, I usually carry a small Bic lighter; they hardly weigh and always work. I carry waterproof matches, Bic lighters (small and big), a Ferro rod, and some fire-starting cubes for car camping. Fire-starting cubes are excellent while camping. They are effortless and can reduce the burden of finding the right tinder and kindling material. I like to use them, especially on a cold morning when I want to get the fire going quickly, mostly on its own, while cooking my breakfast.\nA campfire can keep you warm and cook your food, but it’s not luminous or portable enough to let you navigate the campsite, set up a shelter, or go to the bathroom. Therefore, you need a dedicated battery-operated light source, which could be as simple as your phone’s camera flash or a cheap flashlight from the Dollar Store or Walmart. However, having a headlamp is most versatile in its utility."

Dressing appropriately for the environment is crucial to regulate body temperature and prevent hypothermia or heatstroke. Layering is critical, as it allows you to adjust to changing conditions. Sturdy, comfortable footwear is a must to navigate rugged terrain and prevent blisters. Remember, in the wild, your clothing is not just an outfit; it’s your shield against nature’s challenges.\nBesides clothing, tarps (rain fly), ponchos (rain gear), and tents form the second line of defense against the elements. These cover options shield you from rain, wind, and sun, providing a safe haven to rest and regroup. Whether you are setting up a makeshift shelter or using a compact tent, having the means to create a protective barrier against the wild is essential.\nDepending on the weather forecast, I carry a lightweight poncho on a day hike, which can also be spread on the ground to sit or lie down. If I am not carrying my multipurpose poncho, I carry a lightweight waterproof ground sheet/blanket for lying down. I do not carry tarps or tents on a day hike. However, while car camping with family, I carry several tarps for extra rain cover over our tent and cooking area and one emergency poncho for each family member."

Choose containers that are durable, leak-proof, and lightweight for easy portability.\nFor a short day hike, I usually carry two Smart (plastic) water bottles as they are lightweight, and I am not in danger of getting stranded for an extended period where I have to source water from my surroundings and purify it by boiling. However, if I am camping, I keep plastic water bottles/jugs as primary storage and a metal container, be it a water bottle (single-walled) or a kettle to boil the water. Of course, if you are backpacking, you will carry a kettle to boil the water for your ready-to-eat meals and coffee.\nIf you go to the beach, carry a double-walled insulated water bottle.

From setting up shelter to crafting tools and traps, cordage is the lifeline that enables you to secure, tie, and create. Whether paracord, natural fibers, or improvised materials, having a good supply of cordage opens up a world of possibilities in the wild.\nI am a big fan of paracords from Dollar Tree (25 ft) and Temu.com (100 ft) for setting up tarps over my tent and cooking area. I use the 100 ft cord for the tarp’s ridgeline and 25 ft cords for the guylines, and so far, they have reached even the most distant spread of trees around my campsites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nParacords from Dollar Tree and Temu are cheap, but I would not trust them for critical load-bearing tasks. Even though they are sold as paracords, they do not have any load-bearing capacity rating. The rated 550 paracords should have a load-bearing capacity of 550 lbs.\n\n\nBesides paracords, I also use tarred nylon twine #18 from Walmart’s fishing equipment section. They are also called banklines, and the famous one is #36. Bank lines are much cheaper than paracords and useful for crafts where you want to cut the cord and probably leave it in the wild. I use bank lines to make prusik knots to tension my tarp on the ridgeline."

I also tend to download offline maps of the region I will be traveling to in case there is poor internet connectivity, which usually is many National Parks.\nBesides Google Maps, I also install alternative navigation software that does not depend on the internet, such as OsmAnd+ or Organic Maps. I also recommend paper maps and a compass. However, I realize that only a few people can navigate using a paper map and a compass. It’s a skill worth taking up, and several outdoorsy organizations teach it, including your local REI store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSince our mobile phones are such an integral part of our lives, in addition to keeping my phone in a sturdy phone case, I also carry a waterproof case with floatation that I can hang around my neck with lanyards while I am on the water either kayaking or stand up paddle boarding. Just keeping your phone in a waterproof casing is enough for the rain, but it will sink if it is dropped in the water. Therefore, a case with flotation capabilities is a must.\n\n\nWhile camping (with family), we also carry cheap walkie-talkie radios that kids can use while going to the bathroom or playing near the campsite.

However, getting sick while camping or returning home is not fun. Therefore, keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer. They are not heavy, and some hygiene won’t hurt.\nBugs are everywhere. You are invading their home, so they will not like it and might want to hurt you. So, insect repellents are a must. They protect you from the discomfort of insect bites and insect-borne diseases. Please check the recommended dosage and type of insect repellent for kids before heading out.\nFor bears, while camping or going on long hikes like in the Shenandoah National Parks, I always carry a bear spray can with me. However, before carrying a bear spray, check the park rules if they are allowed and learn how to use them before they are needed in action. Other nonchemical methods to deter a black bear, like a pressure horn or a jingle bell attached to your pack, let the bear know there are people around.\nBeaches are not the only place you might need a splash of sunscreen. Depending upon where you are hiking, you might encounter long stretches of unshaded regions where you may need sun protection. Therefore, keep a small tube of sunscreen."

You can choose one tool per category or multiple, depending on the activity and the people involved. I try to be extra prepared with family and keep backup tools per category.\nThe purpose of this article was to prepare and make you think about what you might need in an outdoor survival situation. It is not to scare you or get paranoid about every little detail. For most outdoor activities, we are not far from help; therefore, don’t get too carried away thinking about survival and miss the beauty and enjoyment of the great outdoors. Otherwise, that would be self-defeating.\nNow get on, and I might meet you on the trail!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate history\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-08-25 First aid kit section added"
